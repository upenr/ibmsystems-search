# Short Summary
This course will show how to install and configure a highly available cluster using IBM PowerHA SystemMirror. It includes hands-on labs.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
40

# Content Description
This course is designed to prepare students to install and configure a highly available cluster using PowerHA SystemMirror. A high availability solution ensures that the failure of any component of the solution, be it hardware, software, or system management, does not cause the application and its data to be inaccessible to the user community.



# Objectives
* Define high availability and explain why it is needed
* List the key considerations when designing and implementing a high availability cluster
* Outline the features and benefits of PowerHA SystemMirror
* Summarize the components of a PowerHA SystemMirror cluster
* Explain how PowerHA SystemMirror operates in typical cases
* List how PowerHA uses networks
* Discuss how Cluster Aware Aix provides monitoring and communication
* Summarize Service IP addresses and how they can be used
* Summarize how IP address takeover (IPAT) is used to keep service addresses available
* Plan and configure shared storages for PowerHA cluster
* Summarize the procedure to install PowerHA SystemMirror
