* Understand how the initial IMS configuration impacts planning for the implementation of Shared Queues
* Identify the key migration and operational considerations of IMS Shared Queues implementation
* Implement, initialize, and access IMS Shared Message Queues (MSGQ) and Shared EMH Queues (EMHQ)
* Describe how IMS Queues, Schedules and processes transactions in a Shared Queues environment
* Identify MSC and conversational processing considerations as well as log records associated with an IMS Shared Queues environment
* Use IMS exits and XCF commands related to IMS Shared Queues
* Tailor IMS System definitions and execution time parameters associated with IMS Shared Queues


# Agenda
* Introduction to Shared Queues
* IMS CQS and Shared Queues Mainline Processing
* Enabling Shared Queues
* Special Considerations


# Audience
This is an intermediate course for experienced IMS programmers, IMS Database (DB) and Transaction Manager (TM) system administrators, IMS application designers, and IMS operations individuals who plan, implement, and support IMS Shared Queues.
