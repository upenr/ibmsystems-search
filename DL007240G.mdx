# Content Description
This is a basic-level course for z/TPF programming basics. The course covers basic concepts, process models, system characteristics, and supported programming languages.

Â 

The course contains 3 units:

**Unit 1: Â Understanding z/TPF**: This unit introduces what the z/TPF system is, what it is capable of, and how programs, packages, and applications are organized in the z/TPF system. This unit also covers some basic concepts of the z/TPF system.

**Unit 2: Â Process Models**: This unit provides an overview of the operating system 5-state process model used by the z/TPF system and the different processing models used by applications.

**Unit 3: Â Programming considerations**: To understand the environment in which programs run on the z/TPF system, you need to understand a little bit about z/Architecture. This unit covers z/TPF system characteristics that are carried over from z/Architecture from the perspective of operating states, virtual memory, memory protection, and the interrupt mechanism. This unit also introduces the programming languages that the z/TPF system supports, as well as how programs written in different languages seamlessly integrate with each other.



# Objectives
* Understand some basic concepts of the z/TPF system
* Describe different z/TPF process models
* Understand the environment in which programs run on the z/TPF system
* Learn how programs in different languages seamlessly integrate with each other on the z/TPF system
