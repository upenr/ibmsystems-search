# Content Description
As IBM Power continues to evolve, it is essential for IT professionals to stay up-to-date with the latest innovations. Our IBM PowerVM course is specifically designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of processor virtualization concepts, Virtual I/O Server configurations, and virtual devices such as virtual Ethernet, virtual SCSI, and virtual Fibre Channel adapters.Â Through a combination of lectures and hands-on labs, this course will equip you with the knowledge and skills necessary to become a successful IT technology professional. Whether you prefer face-to-face or online learning, our experienced instructors will guide you every step of the way as you explore basic and advanced configurations of the Virtual I/O Server and its clients, as well as various availability options.Â 

Expand your knowledge about PowerVM features that were introduced in *Power Systems for AIX I: LPAR Configuration and Planning (AN11G)*.

This course provides lectures and hands on labs in an instructor lead course environment, either in a face-to-face classroom or in a live virtual classroom environment (ILO - Instructor Led Online).



# Objectives
* List the reasons for implementing virtual I/O
* Describe virtual I/O devices
* Describe the function of the Virtual I/O Server
* Configure virtual SCSI devices that are backed by physical volumes, logical volumes, optical media devices, and file-backed devices
* Create the Optical Media Repository, load a CD image, and use it to install a new AIX partition
* Describe how to configure virtual Fibre channel devices using NPIV technology
* Configure Ethernet link aggregation for load balancing and backup channel in the VIOS
* Configure Shared Ethernet adapter failover and load sharing
* Configure vNIC failover
* Perform Virtual I/O Server maintenance operations

# Keywords
AN30G;AN30;Introduction to partitioning;Virtual Ethernet;LPAR

# Prerequisites
You must have advanced system administration experience with AIX 7. This prerequisite can be met by attending one of the following courses:

*Power Systems for AIX II: Implementation and Administration (AN12G)*

*Power Systems for AIX III: Advanced Administration and Problem Determination (AN15G)*

*AIX Jumpstart for UNIX Professionals (AN14G)*

Alternatively, you must have equivalent AIX and LPAR skills.

General TCP/IP knowledge is strongly recommended.

You are also expected to have logical partition administration skills on Power Systems servers, which can be obtained by attending *Power Systems for AIX I: LPAR Configuration and Planning (AN11G)*.
