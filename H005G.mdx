# Short Summary
This course teaches IBM Storage Scale 5.1 Basic Administration for Linux and AIX.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
24

# Content Description
This course is intended for IT professionals tasked with administering an IBM Storage Scale storage cluster in Linux and AIX environments. It includes information on installing, configuring, and monitoring an IBM Storage Scale cluster. Many Storage Scale features are described in lecture materials and then implemented in lab exercises. These features include: Storage management, high availability options, cluster management, and information lifecycle management (ILM) tools.Â Upon completion of this course, you will earn an IBM badge that recognizes your skills and knowledge in this area.Â Note: Although the lab environment is running the Linux operating system, the differences in Storage Scale compared with an AIX environment are minor. Â Therefore, the skills acquired during the course can be applied in both Linux and AIX environments.



# Objectives
After completing this course, you should be able to:

* Summarize the key features of IBM Storage Scale
* Describe IBM ESS and Storage Scale RAID
* Install IBM Storage Scale and configure a cluster
* Manage a cluster
* Implement information lifecycle management (ILM)
* Configure IBM Storage Scale high availability features
* Back up critical cluster data
