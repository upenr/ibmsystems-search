# Short Summary
System Admin or anyone implementing and managing an AIX operating system will learn to install, customize, and administer the AIX operating system in a multiuser Power Systems partitioned environment.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
40

# Content Description
Learn to install, customize, and administer the AIX operating system in a multiuser IBM Power server partitioned environment. The course is based on AIX 7.3 running on a IBM Power server managed by Hardware Management Console and provides practical discussions that are appropriate to earlier AIX releases.



# Objectives
* Install the AIX operating system, filesets, and RedHat Package Manager (RPM) packages
* Perform system startup and shutdown
* Discuss and use system management tools such as System
* Management Interface Tool (SMIT)
* Manage physical and logical devices
* Discuss the purpose of the logical volume manager
* Perform logical volume and file system management
* Create and manage user and group accounts
* Perform and restore system backups
* Utilize administrative subsystems, including cron to schedule system tasks, and security to implement customized access of files and directories
* Configure TCP/IP networking
* Configure and conduct Live Updates on a running AIX LPAR

# Prerequisites
You should already be able to:

* Log in to an AIX system and set a user password
* Execute basic AIX commands
* Manage files and directories
* Use the vi editor
* Use redirection, pipes, and tees
* Use the utilities find and grep
* Use the command and variable substitution
* Set and change Korn shell variables
* Write simple shell scripts

These skills can be acquired by attending *AIX Basics (AN10D1DG)* **or** through equivalent AIX **or** UNIX knowledge. Also, it would be helpful (but not mandatory) if students were familiar with partitioning concepts **and** technology taught in *Power Systems for AIX I: LPAR Configuration and Planning (AN11G)*.
