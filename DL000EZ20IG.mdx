# Short Summary
A deeper dive into concepts required for working on applications on z/OS, including facilities, components, and utilities. Ideal for better understanding the z/Architecture.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
40

# Content Description
This course approaches the many facilities, utilities, rules and concepts of z/OS and the broader z/Architecture as a system which can be learned, expanded, and innovated upon. Learners will see how simple tasks become dispatched on the system, how storage (memory) becomes made available to address spaces, and how the major components of the operating system come together to support applications.Â 

Â 

The content is designed to build the basic skills required for z/OS system programmers. It is the stepping stone to the more specialized courses in the z/OS curriculum. The course concentrates on the basic control program and the service it provides. Even though the course does introduce control blocks and speaks at the control block level, it is not intended to drop into a control block field-level discussion.



# Objectives
After completing this course, you should be able to:

* Explain the MVS functions and control blocks necessary to support a task in a multitasking and multiprocessing environment
* Describe the software and hardware functions that allow a program to interact with programs running in other address spaces, use data in other address spaces, and use data in data spaces
* Trace the flow of an I/O operation from the initial request in the application program through the completion of data transfer
* Identify the control blocks that describe the current status of an I/O requestDescribe the functions of the z/OS BCP Virtual, Real, and Auxiliary Storage Managers
* Describe the functions performed by the Recovery Termination Manager and recovery management components to minimize failure impact and enhance error correction
* Select the appropriate IBM publication to provide further technical information (SRLs,Technical Bulletins, Self-study and other z/OS courses)
* Describe the services provided by cross system extended services (XES)Identify and explain the purpose of the cache, list, and lock structures
