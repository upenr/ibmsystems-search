# Content Description
* z/OS Container Extensions (zCX), a new entitled capability of z/OS 2.4, ushers in a new era ofhybrid computing supporting running Linux applications directly on z/OS.
* IBMÂ® z/OSÂ® Container Extensions (IBM zCX) makes it possible to run Linux on IBM ZÂ®applications that are packaged as Docker container images on z/OS. Application developers candevelop and data centers can operate popular open source packages, Linux applications, IBMsoftware, and third-party software together with z/OS applications and data.


# Objectives
* Describe the components of z/OS Container Extensions (zCX)
* Plan the resources required to setup zCX
* Configure and implement a zCX instance with z/OSMF workflow
* Start and connect to your zCX instance
* Access your zCX CLI Container and issue Docker commands
* Provision and deploy application container using zCX docker CLI
* Create Docker volumes for data persistence
* Monitor and manage your zCX instance and your containers
* Deploy some use-case applications in zCX containers
* Understand the Security considerations for zCX and containers
* Setup zCX user management and authentication
* Implement clustering and orchestration of zCX instances and container
* Understand how to to Dockerize your Applications for z/OS Container Extensions
* Implement a zCX private secure registry to deploy your own containers
* Position zCX in the world of Hybrid Cloud
* Select workloads for zCX
* Determine which application is a good fit for zCX
* Describe some zCX use-cases


# Agenda
In this course we will learn the capabilities and benefits of zCX.

* You will plan, configure and implement a zCX instance with z/OSMF workflows
* You will learn how to use z/OSMF to setup and configure zCX
* Create, provisioning, and deploying a zCX instance
* Use z/OSMF workflows to manage the lifecycle of a zCX instance, deprovision a zCX instance
* Use reconfiguration workflow to increase/decrease resources for zCX instance
* Using zCX Command Line Interface, you will
* Get familiar with the docker CLI
* Explore installing zCX containers within newly provisioned zCX instance
* Provision and deploy application containers using zCX docker CLI commands
* Explore how to cluster zCX applications for higher availability and load balancing
* Operationally control zCX
* Dockerize your Applications for z/OS Container Extensions
* Create Docker volumes for data persistence, monitor and manage your zCX instance and containers
* Implement a zCX private secure registry to deploy your own containers
* Exercises and recorded demos reinforce the concepts and technologies being covered in the lectures.


# Audience
This class is intended for z/OS system programmers and IT specialists incharge of configuring, implementing and deploying zCX under z/OS 2.4. This class is also intended for Application developers who will deploy dockercontainers in a zCX z/OS container extensions instance.
