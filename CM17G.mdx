# Content Description
Learn how to write application programs that use Data Language One (DL/I) to process Information Management System (IMS) databases.



# Objectives
* Describe the basic differences between files and IMS databases as they relate to application program coding and logic
* Describe the terms and processing characteristics of IMS hierarchic data structures
* Construct DL/I calls for either COBOL or PL/I language programs
* Write, test and debug a batch application program that uses the DL/I call functions
* Use the IMS Test Program to prototype application program calls, and to perform ad-hoc read and update access to an IMS database
* Describe the applications and uses of other DL/I features
* Program for recovery and restart using DL/I calls to establish synchronization points
* Describe the functions provided by High Availability Large Database (HALDB), and any program differences when accessing a Full Function database or a HALDB
