# Short Summary
People responsible for designing, implementing, maintaining, ortuning IMS databases using logical relationships.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
32

# Content Description
Learn how to successfully implement and tune Information Management System (IMS) databases with IMS logical relationships. Examine in detail the various pointer options. Practice these skills in intensive machine-lab exercises.



# Objectives
* Code the DBDs and PSBs for databases involved in logical relationships, including those using recursive data structures
* Use IMS utilities to load and reorganize logically related databases
* Choose logical relationship update rules based upon application processing requirements
* Identify DBD coding parameters that are critical to the performance of logically related databases
* Interpret the results of logical relationship implementation choices using the reports provided by the IMS Monitor


# Agenda
* Introduction to Logical Relationships
* Unidirectional Logical Relationships
* Unidirectional Logical Data Structures
* Bidirectional Logical Relationships
* Bidirectional Logical Data Structures
* Database Load and Reorganization
* Recursive Structures
* ISRT Rules and Exercise
* Logical Relationship Performance
* Logical Relationship Tuning
* Design and Change Considerations


# Audience

# Prerequisites
You should have at least four months of experience using IMS and should be able to:


* â€¢ Use TSO/ISPF **or** PDF
* â€¢ Demonstrate basic knowledge of:
	+ OS/VS Job Control Language
	+ VSAM access methods service utilities
	+ DL/I application programming techniques
* Describe the characteristics **and** storage format of HISAM, HIDAM **and** HDAM databases **and** code their DBDs
* Understand the IMS DB Monitor **and** use its reports to resolve database performance concerns


These skills can be developed by attending:


* *IMS Physical Organization of Databases Workshop (CM22)*
* *IMS Database Performance and Tuning Workshop (CM30)*
