# Content Description
This course is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of ZUnit, a powerful unit testing framework specifically tailored for testing z/OS applications and mainframe environments. During this course we will delve into the intricacies of ZUnit, exploring its features, best practices, and practical implementation techniques.Â 

Â 

We further expand on the concepts of integration testing, along with introduction to IBM Z Virtual Test Platform (ZVTP) and its combination with the IBM Distribution for Galasa.Â 

Â 

**Prerequisites**

* Basic z/OS knowledge
* Familiarity with IDz
* Basic Java/Groovy knowledge is an asset but is not required


# Objectives
Learners will be taken through a series of modules that focus on early testing for z/OS applications. At the end of this course, they will be able to understand how z/OS application developers can shift-left and accelerate testing using IBM Z DevOps test tools.Â
