# Content Description
This course begins with an introduction to the z/OS environment, TSO and ISPF/PDF, batch processing, and z/OS data sets. Hands-on labs allow you to gain experience with viewing and allocating data sets, submitting a batch job, and viewing job output. After the introduction to z/OS, you will then learn, through lecture and exercises, how to use basic RACF command parameters and panels to define users and groups, protect general resources, z/OS data sets, and choose a basic set of RACF options.



# Objectives
* List and describe the basic features and concepts of zSeries architecture and of the z/OS operating system as they relate to security administration
* Describe the allocation process for data sets in the z/OS environment
* Identify the security requirements of a system
* Use the basic facilities and features of RACF
* Define users to RACF
* Set up an RACF group structure
* Use RACF to protect resources
* Select a base set of options to tailor RACF
