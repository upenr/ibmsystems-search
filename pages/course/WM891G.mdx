# Content Description
<p>This course is designed to teach you how to connect mobile devices to CICS and run existing or new CICS web service applications. You learn how to enable and implement mobile in CICS, including how to prepare the CICS environment and resources and what CICS provides to assist with the service development, integration, and translations. The course explains implementations such as web service patterns and the web service assistant jobs. It also covers various ways to connect mobile applications to CICS by use of CICS Mobile Extensions, IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation, CICS Transaction Gateway, Liberty Profile, and IBM z/OS Connect feature. The course includes a module on mobile security architectures and securing mobile access to CICS. In the hands-on lab exercises, you perform the necessary steps to configure and implement mobile apps with CICS. The lab exercises implement JSON and SOAP web services in support of mobile applications.</p>
