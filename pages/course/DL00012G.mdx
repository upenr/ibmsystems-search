# Duration in Hours âŒš

# Content Description
z/OS Container Extensions is an exciting new capability that is delivered as part of IBM z/OSÂ V2R4. It is designed to enable the ability to run almost any Docker container that can run onÂ Linux on IBM Z in a z/OS environment alongside existing z/OS applications and data withoutÂ a separateÂ provisionedÂ Linux server.Â This extends the strategic software stack on z/OS as developers can build new, containerizedÂ applications, by using Docker and Linux skills and patterns, and deploy them on z/OS, withoutÂ requiring any z/OS skills. In turn, dataÂ centersÂ can operate popular open source packages,Â Linux applications, IBM software, and third-party software together with z/OS applicationsÂ and data, leveraging industry standard skills.
