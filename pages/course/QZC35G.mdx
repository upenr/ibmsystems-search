# Content Description
<p>This course covers the concepts and implementation details of the software-defined networking and storage features of PowerVC on IBM Power Systems servers, known as IBM Cloud PowerVC Manager Software Defined Infrastructure (SDI). Students learn to implement a PowerVM infrastructure with software-defined storage based on IBM Spectrum Scale using NovaLink in SDE-mode, and software-defined networking based on Open vSwitch (OVS). Methods for capturing, deploying, and managing virtual machines in a software defined infrastructure are also explored.</p>

# Objectives
<p>On completion of this course, students should be able to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Prepare Power Systems servers for a software defined infrastructure using PowerVC SDI</li>
	<li>Install and configure a NovaLink SDE-mode partition on a Power Systems server</li>
	<li>Install IBM Spectrum Scale in an existing PowerVC instance to create an SDI environment</li>
	<li>Enable a VxLAN overlay network and define it into PowerVC</li>
	<li>Manage an SDE (Software Defined Environment)-mode NovaLink server in PowerVC</li>
	<li>Import an image into PowerVC&rsquo;s SDI environment</li>
	<li>Deploy a VM into the SDI environment</li>
	<li>Manage a VM in an SDI environment</li>
</ul>

# Prerequisites
<p>Student must understand base PowerVC and NovaLink concepts. Basic Linux administration skills are also required. These prerequisites can be met by attending the following course:<br />
-QZC30G (Moving to Cloud with IBM Cloud PowerVC Manager), and<br />
-One of the following Linux Administration classes:<br />
&bull;LX032G (RedHat Administration for Power Systems)<br />
&bull;LX041G (Ubuntu Administration for Power Systems)<br />
&bull;LX051G (SUSE Administration for Power Systems)<br />
