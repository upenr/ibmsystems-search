# Short Summary
This basic course is for z/OS system programmers, IT architects, managers, and anyone interested in understanding more about Parallel Sysplex.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
8

# Content Description
<p>This course is designed to provide a fairly detailed overview of the Parallel Sysplex environment. It covers both hardware and software aspects including examples of how certain system components and subsystems exploit sysplex.</p>

# Objectives
<ul>
	<li>Explain the historical perspective of sysplex</li>
	<li>Identify and describe the key components used in a base sysplex configuration</li>
	<li>Identify and describe the key components used in a Parallel Sysplex configuration</li>
	<li>Describe how the CF is defined and connected</li>
	<li>Explain time synchronization in a sysplex</li>
	<li>Describe the overall structure definition process, types, operational use, and some key structure characteristics</li>
	<li>Identify and list users of sysplex services</li>
	<li>Identify and describe various sysplex exploiters and subsystems</li>
</ul>
