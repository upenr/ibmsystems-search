# Short Summary
The audience includes operations personnel and technical staff who are directly involved in the installation, operation, systems support, and software support of their Parallel Sysplex environment.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
24

# Content Description
<p>This course is designed so that students can learn how z/OS systems operate in a Parallel Sysplex environment through discussion topics and hands-on lab exercises. Students learn problem determination skills, practice enhanced sysplex operations, including management of the coupling facility (CF), and use recovery capabilities provided by the System z servers.</p>

<p>The course consists of six units and 12 hands-on lab exercises.</p>

# Objectives
<ul />
	<li />Describe common sysplex terminology, concepts, and benefits provided by a Parallel Sysplex configuration
	<li />Identify the basic hardware and software components that make up the Parallel Sysplex environment and how they are used
	<li />Use z/OS MVS commands to identify XCF signaling and sysplex shared couple data set usage and to determine current operational status
	<li />Describe CF operation; how and when the CFCC is loaded on a System z LPAR, the various CF link definitions and how they can be used
	<li />Identify CF structure types, definition and allocation process, and how they are used in the CF
	<li />Use z/OS MVS commands to display structure status
	<li />Use CF operator commands to display and change the operational status of a CF
	<li />Describe and demonstrate recommended procedures and typical z/OS MVS commands to manage sysplex members, coupling facilities, structure rebuilds, and couple data sets
	<li />Identify potential problems during system removal, CF structure or CDS usage, and determine appropriate operator action
	<li />Explain the differences and benefits of having stand-alone CF and internal CF configurations
	<li />Describe the purpose and use of Sysplex Failure Manager and how SFM can be used to address sympathy sickness
	<li />Explain why time synchronization is important and how server time protocol is used
	<li />Describe console usage and mode of operation for a system and a sysplex
	<li />Describe the IPL sequence and identify where and when sysplex activation is done during IPL
	<li />Identify key areas with the IPL, explaining potential problems and how to avoid them
