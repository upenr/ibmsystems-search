# Short Summary
This intermediate course is for anyone who works on TCP/IP networks and provides support in the resolution of communication problems on z/OS.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
32

# Content Description
<p>This course is designed to give you the skill required to diagnose and debug TCP/IP problems when operating on z/OS. This skill consists in developing knowledge of commands and tools together with a methodology in tackling TCP/IP problems.</p>

<p>The lab activity and paper projects provide an opportunity to debug real problems.</p>

# Objectives
<ul>
	<li>Learn what commands are useful in a z/OS environment to control TCP/IP resources, the TELNET application, and debug TCP/IP simple network problems</li>
	<li>Learn which trace types (packet, TELNET, FTP, and so forth) are available in a z/OS environment and know:
	<ul>
		<li>What kind of information can be found in a trace</li>
		<li>When to activate a trace</li>
		<li>How to activate a trace</li>
		<li>How to interpret a trace (for the packet trace there is a dedicated topic)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Use the proper diagnostic technique to approach TCP/IP problems</li>
	<li>Describe the Syslog function in the UNIX environment and know how to configure the /etc/syslog.conf file</li>
	<li>Understand how to handle and modify the translate tables used by many TCP/IP applications that connect to remote systems which use ASCII character coding</li>
	<li>Activate and interpret several trace types, and debug some real problems which involve the use of various application protocols.</li>
</ul>
