# Duration in Hours âŒš
8

# Content Description
Red Hat OpenShift combines tested and trusted services for modernizing and managing applications across public cloud, on-premises, hybrid cloud, or edge architecture.

Â 

This course covers cloud foundations, PowerVS, Kubernetes, and OpenShift. It provides an overall understanding of building, deploying, and configuring containerized applications on OpenShift running on IBM Cloud.Â 

Â 

This course is structured into three key components. The initial segment delves into the fundamentals, covering Containerization, Kubernetes, OpenShift, and IBM Cloud. Following that, we'll learn the practical aspect, learning how to configure OpenShift on IBM Power Virtual Server. The final stage is all about application deployment on IBM Power Virtual Server, allowing us to apply our knowledge in real-world scenarios.



# Objectives
* Summarize the significance of the IBM PowerVS Cloud solution on the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
* Learn about Kubernetes and OpenShift for container orchestration
* Demonstrate how to build, deploy, and configure containerized applications on OpenShift running on IBM PowerVS
