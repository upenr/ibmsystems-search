# Short Summary
This course is designed to expand on Linux storage management in a Power Systems environment.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
16

# Content Description
<p>This course is designed to provide the students with what they need to know when managing storage in a Linux on Power environment. &nbsp;IBM Power Systems provide a large variety of storage options and combining these options with Linux storage management techniques is a critical skill required by today&rsquo;s system administrator.</p>

<p>This course provides students with an opportunity to work with Power Systems storage devices, focusing on those skill sets needed to manage these devices on Linux Servers.</p>

# Objectives
<p>After completing this course, you should be able to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Describe storage options for Linux distributions running in a Power Systems environment</li>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interpret storage configuration data</li>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Implement storage devices with PowerVM
	<ul>
		<li>VIOS</li>
		<li>Fibre Channel</li>
		<li>&nbsp;iSCSI</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Differentiate native Linux and hardware RAID solutions</li>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Validate configuration options</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Design solutions for attaching storage resources to a Linux on Power host</p>
