# Short Summary
Implementation of IBM Spectrum Control and IBM Storage Insights to analyze and manage your software-defined storage environment.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
4

# Content Description
IBM Spectrum Control is an integrated data and storage management software that provides monitoring, automation, and analytics for organizations with multiple storage systems, while IBM Storage Insights is a cloud-based service that provides visibility across storage environments to help manage complex storage infrastructures.

Â 

This course provides an overview of IBM Spectrum Control and IBM Storage Insights and how these products can help you analyze and manage your storage. This course walks you through the IBM Spectrum Control installation process, then guides you through the basic administrative tasks, including how to add devices, use and configure Probes, set up the Performance Monitor, and employ Tasks. This course also covers how to access IBM Storage Insights services using an IBM ID, install a Data Collector, add a storage system, and explore the graphical interface. You will be able to practice these skills in a set of online exercises. Last, we will demonstrate how IBM Spectrum Control Advanced Analytics can analyze tiers, balance pools, and reclaim and provision storage.
