# Short Summary
FlashSystem V9000 delivers the full capabilities of IBM FlashCore technology plus a rich set of storage virtualization features.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
24

# Content Description
<p>This course starts with an overview of the IBM FlashSystem V9000 and IBM FlashSystem 900 all-flash storage solutions.&nbsp; We will review the history of IBM flash storage and describes the key elements of the IBM FlashCore Technology. You will review Hardware Accelerated I/O, IBM MicroLatency Module, and Advanced Flash Management and how each element is employed in IBM FlashSystem 900 and IBM FlashSystem V9000 storage solution. We will then discuss the advantage of the IBM FlashCore Technology and it usage.</p>
