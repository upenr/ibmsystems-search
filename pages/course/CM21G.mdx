# Content Description
<p>This course teaches a methodology to tune a large-scale z/OS IMS/TM data communication system. Specifically, this course explains the impact of user-specified options on IMS performance, how to determine performance bottlenecks by interpreting information from certain performance reports, and how to use the information gained to implement a plan to improve the performance of an IMS system.</p>

# Objectives
<ul><li>Create and implement a performance improvement plan based on the methodology presented
</li><li>Discuss the performance options available to the IMS user
</li><li>Describe the performance impact of the IMS storage pools and datasets and their interrelationships
</li><li>Interpret the information contained in performance reports
</li><li>Analyze the performance reports to determine performance bottlenecks in the IMS system</li></ul>

# Agenda
<ul><li>Monitoring and Tuning Overview</li><li>IMS Structure and Major Control Blocks</li><li>IMS Logger and Pool Management</li><li>IMS Communications Component</li><li>IMS OTMA Communication Component</li><li>MVS Considerations for IMS</li><li>IMS Scheduling</li><li>IMS Program Load</li><li>Program Elapsed Time</li><li>IMS Database Buffering</li></ul>

# Audience
<p>This course is for experienced IMS system programmers or performance analysts responsible for the performance of a large-scale IMS DB/DC system.</p>
