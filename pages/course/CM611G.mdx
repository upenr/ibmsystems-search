# Content Description
<p>This course is designed to teach students about a key availability and capacity enhancement to Information Management System (IMS) - the Shared Queues facility, which offers the ability to share full function message queues within a parallel sysplex environment. Also, learn about sharing Fast Path Expedited Message Handler (EMH) queues within a parallel sysplex environment.</p>

# Objectives
<ul>
	<li>Describe the hardware and software components of IMS Shared Queues</li>
	<li>Understand how the initial IMS configuration impacts planning for the implementation of Shared Queues</li>
	<li>Identify the key migration and operational considerations of IMS Shared Queues implementation</li>
	<li>Implement, initialize, and access IMS Shared Message Queues (MSGQ) and Shared EMH Queues (EMHQ)</li>
	<li>Describe how IMS queues, schedules and process transactions in a Shared Queues environment</li>
	<li>Identify MSC and conversational processing considerations as well as log records associated with an IMS Shared Queues environment</li>
	<li>Use IMS exits and XCF commands related to IMS Shared Queues</li>
	<li>Tailor IMS system definitions and execution time parameters associated with IMS Shared Queues</li>
</ul>
