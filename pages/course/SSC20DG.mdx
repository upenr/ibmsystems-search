# Content Description
The foundations of the IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) solution for on-premises systems are covered in this course. It introduces students to IBM Cloud Object Storage, how to install the solution, configure it, and navigate the user interface.

The course delves deeper into how to make capacity changes, self-healing features, and how to examine logs and troubleshoot IBM Cloud Object Storage.

There are pre-recorded lab demos to show these concepts in action.

This course earns you the IBM Cloud Object Storage Technical Essentials badge (https://www.credly.com/org/ibm/badge/ibm-cloud-object-storage-technical-essentials).
