# Short Summary
This advanced course is for experienced IMS system programmers or performance analysts responsible for the performance of a large-scale IMS DB/DC system.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
24

# Content Description
<p>Learn a methodology to improve the performance of a large-scale z/OS IMS/TM data communication system. This course explains the impact of user-specified options on IMS performance, how to determine performance bottlenecks by interpreting information from certain performance reports, and how to use the information gained to implement a plan to improve the performance of an IMS system.</p>

# Objectives
<ul />
	<li />Create and implement a performance improvement plan based on the methodology presented
	<li />Discuss the performance options available to the IMS user
	<li />Describe the performance impact of the IMS storage pools and datasets and their interrelationships
	<li />Interpret the information contained in performance reports
	<li />Analyze the performance reports to determine performance bottlenecks in the IMS system


# Agenda
<ul /><li />Monitoring and Tuning Overview<li />IMS Structure and Major Control Blocks<li />The IMS Logger and Pool Management<li />IMS Communication Component<li />IMS OTMA (Open Transaction Management Access) Communication Component<li />z/OS Considerations for IMS<li />IMS Scheduling<li />IMS Program Loading Options<li />IMS Program Elapsed Time<li />IMS Database Buffering
