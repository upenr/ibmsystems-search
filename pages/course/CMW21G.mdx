# Short Summary
This advanced course is for experienced IMS system programmers or performance analysts responsible for the performance of a large-scale IMS DB/DC system.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
24

# Content Description
<p>Learn a methodology to improve the performance of a large-scale z/OS IMS/TM data communication system. This course explains the impact of user-specified options on IMS performance, how to determine performance bottlenecks by interpreting information from certain performance reports, and how to use the information gained to implement a plan to improve the performance of an IMS system.</p>

# Objectives
<ul>
	<li>Create and implement a performance improvement plan based on the methodology presented</li>
	<li>Discuss the performance options available to the IMS user</li>
	<li>Describe the performance impact of the IMS storage pools and datasets and their interrelationships</li>
	<li>Interpret the information contained in performance reports</li>
	<li>Analyze the performance reports to determine performance bottlenecks in the IMS system</li>
</ul>

# Agenda
