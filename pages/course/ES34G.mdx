# Duration in Hours âŒš

# Content Description
<p>This classroom hands-on lab course provides an introduction to the mainframe Assembler language. The course is designed to develop the skills appropriate to write and/or maintain programs and routines written in S/370 or S/390 Assembler Language. Emphasis is placed on enhancing skills in problem resolution through program check interruption analysis and dump reading.</p>

# Objectives
<ul />
	<li />Recognize architectural features, such as instruction formats, data representation, storage addressing, and so on, which are significant to program analysis
	<li />Identify point of program interruption, using the formatted system dump and elements of information such as the Program Status Word (PSW), the Instruction Length Code (ILC), the program&#39;s base register(s), and so on
	<li />Identify appropriate standards for assembler programs in terms of program organization, register conventions, coding practices, documentation, and so on
	<li />Code and debug assembler language programs which:
	<li />Conform to standard linkage conventions using save area chaining
	<li />Define and use various types of data definitions, including fixed point binary, character, hexadecimal, and packed decimal
	<li />Employ standard macros such as CALL, SAVE, RETURN
	<li />Use various Assembler Language statements such as CSECT, EQU, COPY, END
	<li />Use both symbolic and explicit notational forms for instructions
	<li />Use data literals appropriately, and explain the use of LTORG to direct positioning of the literal pool
	<li />Create and use appropriate patterns for EDIT instructions
