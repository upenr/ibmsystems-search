# Content Description
<p>This classroom hands-on lab course provides an introduction to the mainframe Assembler language. The course is designed to develop the skills appropriate to write and/or maintain programs and routines written in S/370 or S/390 Assembler Language. Emphasis is placed on enhancing skills in problem resolution through program check interruption analysis and dump reading.</p>

# Objectives
<ul>
	<li>Recognize architectural features, such as instruction formats, data representation, storage addressing, and so on, which are significant to program analysis</li>
	<li>Identify point of program interruption, using the formatted system dump and elements of information such as the Program Status Word (PSW), the Instruction Length Code (ILC), the program&#39;s base register(s), and so on</li>
	<li>Identify appropriate standards for assembler programs in terms of program organization, register conventions, coding practices, documentation, and so on</li>
	<li>Code and debug assembler language programs which:</li>
	<li>Conform to standard linkage conventions using save area chaining</li>
	<li>Define and use various types of data definitions, including fixed point binary, character, hexadecimal, and packed decimal</li>
	<li>Employ standard macros such as CALL, SAVE, RETURN</li>
	<li>Use various Assembler Language statements such as CSECT, EQU, COPY, END</li>
	<li>Use both symbolic and explicit notational forms for instructions</li>
	<li>Use data literals appropriately, and explain the use of LTORG to direct positioning of the literal pool</li>
	<li>Create and use appropriate patterns for EDIT instructions</li>
</ul>
