# Short Summary
This module introduces IBM Spectrum Virtualize support for traditional RAID and Distributed RAID arrays.

# Duration in Hours âŒš

# Content Description
<p>This module introduces IBM Spectrum Virtualize support for traditional RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) arrays and the Distributed RAID arrays. Traditional RAID (or TRAID) and Distributed RAID (or DRAID) arrays are both data storage virtualization technologies that combines multiple physical disk drive components into one or more logical units. TRAID and DRAID offers increased storage performance, resiliency and low cost, with improved higher availability to recreate lost data from parity information. This module also discuss the benefits of implementing DRAID 6 to boost IO performance versus TRAID 5 in almost all production workloads.</p>
