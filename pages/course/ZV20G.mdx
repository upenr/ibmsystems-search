# Content Description
<p>This course introduces the students to the implementation of the DirMaint and RACF Security Server for z/VM program products. The class focuses on the required steps of implementing DirMaint and RACF Security Server for z/VM in the z/VM 6.3 environment. The students participate in hands-on labs where they install, tailor, and use these two program products from an end user and system programmer view point.</p>

# Objectives
<ul>
	<li>Implement DirMaint on a z/VM 6.3.0</li>
	<li>Manage the virtual machines in a z/VM 6.3.0 system using DirMaint</li>
	<li>Implement RACF Security Server for z/VM on a z/VM 6.3.0 system</li>
	<li>Secure your z/VM system using the RACF Security Server</li>
</ul>
