# Content Description
This short course provides an overview of cloud computing and storage. Cloud storage can be thought of as a scalable way to store, access, and share data over the Intranet or the Internet. Before talking about how IBMâ€™s storage products integrate with the cloud, we will present an overview of cloud computing in general. OpenStack is a collection of open source software projects that enterprises/service providers can use to setup and run their private cloud. Learning OpenStack will help you understand the concepts of cloud computing, which can be later used in other cloud environments. Therefore, we will present an overview of OpenStack here, followed by a discussion on IBM Storage's stride in this direction.

# Objectives
