# Short Summary
Anyone who needs to learn about DS8000 implementation and experiment with them on a real test configuration.                                                                                            

# Duration in Hours ⌚
24

# Content Description
To learn the DS8000 storage subsystem and its hardware components and logical structure. You configure the DS8000 storage subsystem using a DS8000 Storage Manager GUI and review the DS CLI interface for scripting configuration functions. You will also perform dynamic data relocation using Easy Tier function. In addition we have a unit on the recently announced product called the DS8900F.



# Objectives
*  Using the history, hardware & software features, functions, and components of the DS8000 family determine the architecture of the DS8880   
*  Distinguish those elements that contribute to virtualization and the DS8880   
*  Carry out those steps needed to configure the DS8880, using the Data Storage Command Line Interface (DS CLI)   
*  Carry out those steps needed to configure the DS8880, using the data storage Graphical User Interface (GUI)   
*  Outline those benefits of host attachments that will enable higher throughput and lower response times when connecting a DS8880 to your z System   
*  Clarify the features of cache, performance identification, and TPC and their contributions to the physical and logical setup of the DS8880   
*  Relate those functions of copy services, flash copy, and global mirroring to business continuity   
*  Summarize the features and functions of the DS8900F  
*  Distinguish the benefits of the three DS8900F models
