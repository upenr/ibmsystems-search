# Short Summary
This course is for administrators familiar with the daily management tasks on a single server, and focuses on incorporating more advanced features, including replication and cloud object storage.

# Duration in Hours âŒš

# Content Description
IBM Spectrum Protect is an enterprise data protection solution designed to help you streamline your data protection processing, reduce the cost of storage, and provide the flexibility and security to meet any service level agreement. IBM Spectrum Protect optimizes storage utilization by using incremental forever as well as block-level backup and replication, policy-based data management, and an intuitive interface, the Operations Center.

Â 

In this course, you learn how the use of two or more Spectrum Protect servers provides more options for data movement in the environment, like replication to multiple targets. You also use IBM Cloud Object Storage to create a storage pool for backups and long-term retention. The bulk of the administrative tasks are performed using the Operations Center and Command Builder which provides a command line interface for all servers configured in the Operations Center. This course also includes scripting, performance tuning, protecting, and recovering the database and storage pools, and an introduction to IBM Spectrum Protect Plus.

Â 

The hands-on exercises are performed on three different IBM Spectrum Protect servers, two on Windows, and one on Linux, with additional systems added to provide the IBM Cloud Object Storage environment.

Â 

This course is the second in a two-course series. It is for Spectrum Protect administrators who are familiar with the daily management tasks on a single server, and focuses on incorporating more advanced features, including replication and use of cloud object storage. Basic concepts and installation are not covered in this course.Â 

Â 

TS619G, the first course in the series, IBM Spectrum Protect 8.1.12 Implementation and Administration, covers installation and basic administration of a single server.
