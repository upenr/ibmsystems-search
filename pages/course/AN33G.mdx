# Content Description
This course describes the concepts and configuration details when implementing PowerVM Live Partition Mobility on POWER6 and POWER7 processor-based servers. Students will learn the requirements of Live Partition Mobility and will configure HMCs, Virtual I/O Servers, and partitions in preparation for performing active and inactive migrations. Live hands-on exercises will allow students to configure a lab environment and perform Live Partition Mobility operations.


This course provides lectures and hands on labs in an instructor lead course environment, either in a face-to-face classroom or in a live virtual classroom environment (ILO - Instructor Led Online).



# Objectives
* Describe key components of Live Partition Mobility
* Describe configuration settings necessary for the HMCs, the source and target Virtual I/O servers, and the mobile LPAR
* Perform and monitor PowerVM Live Partition Mobility operations
* Describe differences between active and inactive Live Partition Mobility configuration and operations
* Describe advanced migration configuration and tuning options when using the migrlpar command


# Agenda
* Live Partition Mobility (LPM) overview
* Virtual I/O Server and mobile configuration
* Partition migration operations
* Advanced LPM scenarios


# Audience
The audiences for this advanced training include AIX/Linux technical support individuals, system administrators, system architects and engineers, and anyone who needs a technical operational understanding of PowerVM Live Partition Mobility.
