# Content Description
<p>This course describes the concepts and configuration details when implementing PowerVM Live Partition Mobility on POWER6 and POWER7 processor-based servers. Students will learn the requirements of Live Partition Mobility and will configure HMCs, Virtual I/O Servers, and partitions in preparation for performing active and inactive migrations. Live hands-on exercises will allow students to configure a lab environment and perform Live Partition Mobility operations.</p>

<p>This course provides lectures and hands on labs in an instructor lead course environment, either in a face-to-face classroom or in a live virtual classroom environment (ILO - Instructor Led Online).</p>

# Objectives
<ul>
	<li>Describe key components of Live Partition Mobility</li>
	<li>Describe configuration settings necessary for the HMCs, the source and target Virtual I/O servers, and the mobile LPAR</li>
	<li>Perform and monitor PowerVM Live Partition Mobility operations</li>
	<li>Describe differences between active and inactive Live Partition Mobility configuration and operations</li>
	<li>Describe advanced migration configuration and tuning options when using the <em>migrlpar </em>command</li>
</ul>

# Agenda
<ul><li>Live Partition Mobility (LPM) overview</li><li>Virtual I/O Server and mobile configuration</li><li>Partition migration operations</li><li>Advanced LPM scenarios</li></ul>
