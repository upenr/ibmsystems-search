# Content Description
This 2 day course provides students with the skills needed to implement and manager the IBM VM Recovery Manager â€“ HA (VMR-HA) product.Â  Topics include introduction to High Availability (HA) and Disaster Recovery (DR), understanding the requirements and planning for implementing VMR-HA, installing and configuring VMR-HA, and testing the capabilities of VMR-HA at the VM and application level. Hands-on exercises reinforce the lecture material, allowing students to install, configure, test, and maintain VMR-HA environments.



# Objectives
* Describe industry terminology and concepts for High Availability (HA) and Disaster Recover (DR)
* Plan for the installation of VM Recovery Manager 1.5
* Install VM Recovery Manager â€“ HA (VMR-HA) components
	+ - Describe the installation of VIOS efix
	+ - Install VM Recovery Manager HA KSYS and GUI software
	+ - Install the VM agent on managed LPARs
* Configure VMR-HA
	+ - Declare the infrastructure environment : HMC, Hosts, VIOS
	+ - Create the host groups : the hosts you want to protect against failures
	+ - Select the managed VM, configure and enable them for HA
* Describe how VMR-HA functions at the VM and application levels
* Manage and monitor KSYS using the provided tools
* Install and check VMR-HA agent status
* Register an application with the VMR-HA agent
* Recover standard and critical applications
