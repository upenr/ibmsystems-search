# Short Summary
Learn how to create policy definitions for systems, applications, application groups, and monitor resources  for IBM System Automation for z/OS V4.1

# Duration in Hours âŒš
40.0

# Content Description
In this course, you learn how to define automation policy for IBM System Automation for z/OSÂ® (SA z/OS).  
You learn how to create policy definitions for systems, applications, application groups, and monitor resources. Â This Â is delivered in an environment with multiple opportunities for hands-on lab exercises. Â You define automation policy for several environments: single system and multiple system within a basic sysplex. Â The System Automation for z/OS automation manager and automation agent run in a z/OS 2.2 environment. Â The automation platform, TivoliÂ® NetView for z/OS is at version 6 release 2.



# Objectives
* System Automation for z/OS overview
* Installation and customization
* Customization Dialog and Policy Data Base
* Defining Applications and building automation configuration files
* Additional customization: explore features and functions including use of symbolics in the policy, Application classes, suspend file, Notify Operators, Service Periods, Events, Triggers, and monitor resources
* Initialization and runmodes
* Gateways and Status Display Facility
* Defining Application Groups
* End-to-end automation: extend automation to cross-sysplex and to true end-to-end cross platform automation. Use the Universal Automation Adapter to automate resources on distributed systems, for instance running on Linux
* Performance-based automation with OMEGAMON
* Migration and coexistence with previous releases of SA z/OS
