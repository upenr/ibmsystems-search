# Short Summary
Learn how to create policy definitions for systems, applications, application groups, and monitor resources  for IBM System Automation for z/OS V4.1

# Duration in Hours âŒš
40

# Content Description
<p>In this course, you learn how to define automation policy for IBM System Automation for z/OSÂ® (SA z/OS).<br />You learn how to create policy definitions for systems, applications, application groups, and monitor resources. &nbsp;This &nbsp;is delivered in an environment with multiple opportunities for hands-on lab exercises. &nbsp;You define automation policy for several environments: single system and multiple system within a basic sysplex. &nbsp;The System Automation for z/OS automation manager and automation agent run in a z/OS 2.2 environment. &nbsp;The automation platform, TivoliÂ® NetView for z/OS is at version 6 release 2.</p>

# Objectives
<ul /><li />System Automation for z/OS overview<li />Installation and customization<li />Customization Dialog and Policy Data Base<li />Defining Applications and building automation configuration files<li />Additional customization: explore features and functions including use of symbolics in the policy, Application classes, suspend file, Notify Operators, Service Periods, Events, Triggers, and monitor resources<li />Initialization and runmodes<li />Gateways and Status Display Facility<li />Defining Application Groups<li />End-to-end automation: extend automation to cross-sysplex and to true end-to-end cross platform automation. Use the Universal Automation Adapter to automate resources on distributed systems, for instance running on Linux<li />Performance-based automation with OMEGAMON<li />Migration and coexistence with previous releases of SA z/OS
