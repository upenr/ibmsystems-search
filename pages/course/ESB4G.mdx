# Content Description
<p>Liberty profile is a new application server run-time model that is available on all platforms supported by the WebSphere Application Server V8.5 product.</p>

<p>The IBM WebSphere Application Server "Liberty Profile" is a significant new approach to application serving. The Liberty Profile is designed to be composable, lightweight, dynamic and fast: Liberty is small, lightweight, highly composable, fast-to-start, dynamic application server runtime environment, with simple configuration. It can be deployed and started in seconds so it's an ideal Java runtime for the cloud.</p>

<p>Liberty for z/OS provides the same features as Liberty on other platforms along with independently enabled extensions that exploit z/OS facilities such as Workload Manager (WLM), Resource Recovery Services (RRS) and System Access Facility (SAF), which provides close integration with the z/OS operating system.</p>

<p>WebSphere Liberty for z/OS provides the base infrastruture for z/OS Connect and WOLA which enables z/OS systems such as CICS and IMS to better and more easily participate in today's Mobile computing environment.</p>

<p>This course introduces the WebSphere Application Server Liberty Profile on z/OS and covers installation and configuration. It describes how to install and administer a Liberty profile server as a started task, along with command-line scripts. The course also explains how to manage and monitor a Liberty for z/OS server environment.</p>

# Objectives

	<li>Install and configure the z/OS Liberty profile</li>
	<li>Describe Liberty profile features that are specific to z/OS</li>
	<li>Deploy applications to a server</li>
	<li>Create and configure z/OS Liberty profile servers</li>
	<li>Deploy applications by adding configuration elements and by using a monitored directory</li>
	<li>Configure data sources and application security</li>
	<li>Use tools to monitor, tune, and troubleshoot Liberty profile resources</li>
	<li>Use the Administration Center to manage Liberty servers</li>
</ul>
