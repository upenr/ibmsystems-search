# Content Description
<p>IBM PowerVC for Private Cloud, an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) offering, provides a self-service cloud portal for IBM Power Systems and is built on OpenStack. OpenStack is a collection of open source software projects that enterprises or service providers can use to setup and run their cloud compute and storage infrastructure. IBM PowerVC for Private Cloud provides an easy way to provision and manage virtual machines on IBM PowerVM based systems in a private or hybrid cloud setting. It comes in two versions, a standard edition and a cloud edition.<br /><br />This course aims to provide an overall understanding of how to install and configure IBM PowerVC Standard Edition and IBM PowerVC for Private Cloud, in an environment with HMC and IBM PowerVM NovaLink. The hands-on lab covers exercises from the basics of installing IBM PowerVC to performing advanced administrative tasks. The course also clarifies concepts in planning, deploying, and implementing IBM PowerVC for Private Cloud and IBM PowerVM NovaLink based on technology standpoints, product architectures, and their benefits.</p>
