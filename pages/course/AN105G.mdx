# Prerequisites
<p>The course covers a broad variety of topics. In order to understand an enhancement to a product, a student must generally have existing knowledge of that product. However, students cannot be expected to have existing knowledge of all products covered in the course. The course will provide some context for enhancements when necessary, but it cannot describe basic first principles for all products.<br />
Students must have basic AIX, LPAR, and PowerVM system administration experience. The AIX prerequisite can be met by attending one of the following courses or students can have equivalent AIX skills:<br />
&bull; AN12G: Power Systems for AIX II: AIX Implementation and Administration<br />
&bull; AN14G: AIX Jumpstart for UNIX Professionals<br />
The PowerVM, Virtual I/O Server and HMC prerequisite skills can be met by attending the following courses or students can have equivalent skills.<br />
&bull; AN30G: Power Systems for AIX - Virtualization I: Implementing Virtualization<br />
&bull; AN31G: Power Systems for AIX - Virtualization II: Advanced PowerVM and Performance<br />
&bull; AN32G: Power Systems for AIX - Virtualization III: Implementing Shared Storage Pools<br />
&bull; AN33G: Implementing PowerVM Live Partition Mobility</p>
