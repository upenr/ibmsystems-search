# Short Summary
This is an intermediate course for z/OS system programmers, z/OS performance analysts, and z/OS performance administrators new to performance management for their z/OS system.Note: 

# Duration in Hours âŒš
36

# Content Description
<p>Do you need to know how to establish a practical performance management program for your z/OS system? This course is designed for new performance analysts to learn to work with the Workload Manager (WLM) in goal mode. Learn concepts of WLM and performance management in the z/OS system using the WLM.</p>

<p>Learn how to analyze Resource Monitoring Facility (RMF) reports and implement service definitions using the WLM Interactive System Productivity Facility (ISPF) application. The course uses z/OS hands-on lab exercises to reinforce the concepts and techniques discussed in lecture.</p>

<p><strong>Hands-on labs</strong></p>

<p>This course includes hands-on lab exercises. Each student team, working on their own z/OS system, will configure RMF, analyze RMF reports to find bottlenecks, and utilize the WLM dialogs to create goals and classification rules in a service definition that manages a supplied z/OS workload.</p>

# Objectives
<ul />
	<li />Describe a performance and tuning methodology
	<li />Develop a systematic z/OS performance and tuning plan
	<li />Describe the factors which could affect the performance of an z/OS system
	<li />Use the WLM ISPF application
	<li />Describe the components of a service definition
	<li />Define workloads and service levels and classification rules
	<li />State which z/OS commands affect WLM operation
	<li />Identify the major WLM services for z/OS, including enclaves and application environments, and how they are used by DB2, WebSphere, and CICS
	<li />Analyze CPU performance when running in a shared LPAR environment
	<li />Utilize and monitor zIIP and zAAP specialty engines
	<li />Measure and tune z/OS DASD, processor storage, and coupling facility configurations
	<li />Explain the functions and facilities of RMF and SMF
	<li />Analyze performance bottlenecks using RMF
	<li />Use Workload License Charges (WLC), defined capacity and soft capping to manage software costs
	<li />Describe advanced z/OS environments that utilize Intelligent Resource Director (IRD), HiperDispatch, z/OSMF Workload Management, and I/O Priority Manager
	<li />Use the z/OSMF Workload Management (WLM) task
	<ul />
		<li />Use Performance Monitoring with z/OSMF
		<li />Modify a WLM service definition to meet the requirements for monitoring a specific system workload
		<li />Create and customize Monitoring Desktops
		<li />Review any issues by using the Monitoring Desktops options displays
		<li />Assess the performance of the workloads running on the z/OS
