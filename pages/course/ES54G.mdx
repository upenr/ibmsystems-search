# Short Summary
This is an intermediate course for z/OS system programmers, z/OS performance analysts, and z/OS performance administrators new to performance management for their z/OS system.Note:

# Duration in Hours âŒš
36

# Content Description
<p>Do you need to know how to establish a practical performance management program for your z/OS system? This course is designed for new performance analysts to learn to work with the Workload Manager (WLM) in goal mode. Learn concepts of WLM and performance management in the z/OS system using the WLM.</p>

<p>Learn how to analyze Resource Monitoring Facility (RMF) reports and implement service definitions using the WLM Interactive System Productivity Facility (ISPF) application. The course uses z/OS hands-on lab exercises to reinforce the concepts and techniques discussed in lecture.</p>

<p><strong>Hands-on labs</strong></p>

<p>This course includes hands-on lab exercises. Each student team, working on their own z/OS system, will configure RMF, analyze RMF reports to find bottlenecks, and utilize the WLM dialogs to create goals and classification rules in a service definition that manages a supplied z/OS workload.</p>

# Objectives
<ul>
	<li>Describe a performance and tuning methodology</li>
	<li>Develop a systematic z/OS performance and tuning plan</li>
	<li>Describe the factors which could affect the performance of an z/OS system</li>
	<li>Use the WLM ISPF application</li>
	<li>Describe the components of a service definition</li>
	<li>Define workloads and service levels and classification rules</li>
	<li>State which z/OS commands affect WLM operation</li>
	<li>Identify the major WLM services for z/OS, including enclaves and application environments, and how they are used by DB2, WebSphere, and CICS</li>
	<li>Analyze CPU performance when running in a shared LPAR environment</li>
	<li>Utilize and monitor zIIP and zAAP specialty engines</li>
	<li>Measure and tune z/OS DASD, processor storage, and coupling facility configurations</li>
	<li>Explain the functions and facilities of RMF and SMF</li>
	<li>Analyze performance bottlenecks using RMF</li>
	<li>Use Workload License Charges (WLC), defined capacity and soft capping to manage software costs</li>
	<li>Describe advanced z/OS environments that utilize Intelligent Resource Director (IRD), HiperDispatch, z/OSMF Workload Management, and I/O Priority Manager</li>
	<li>Use the z/OSMF Workload Management (WLM) task
	<ul>
		<li>Use Performance Monitoring with z/OSMF</li>
		<li>Modify a WLM service definition to meet the requirements for monitoring a specific system workload</li>
		<li>Create and customize Monitoring Desktops</li>
		<li>Review any issues by using the Monitoring Desktops options displays</li>
		<li>Assess the performance of the workloads running on the z/OS</li>
	</ul>
