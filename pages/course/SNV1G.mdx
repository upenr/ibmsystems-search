# Short Summary
This lecture and exercise-based course is for those individuals who are assessing and/or planning to deploy IBM System Storage networked storage virtualization solutions.


# Duration in Hours âŒš
32.0

# Content Description
This course is designed to leverage SAN storage connectivity by integrating a layer of intelligence in Â virtualization. The SAN Volume Controller (SVC) facilitates storage application data access independence from storage management functions and requirements. This focus is on planning and implementation tasks associated with integrating the SVC into the storage area network.Â 

It also explains how to:

â€¢ Centralize storage provisioning to host servers from common storage pools.  
â€¢ Improve storage optimization and efficiency through Thin Provisioning, Data Reduction and CompressionÂ   
â€¢ Implement storage tiering and optimize flash drives and storage usage with Easy Tier  
â€¢ Facilitate the coexistence and migration of data from non-virtualized to the virtualized environment.Â   
â€¢ Utilize network-level storage subsystem-independent data replication services to satisfy backup and disaster recovery requirement.

This course offering is at the IBM Spectrum Virtualize V8.2.1.1 level.
