# Short Summary
An online course to understand IBM Elastic Storage Server's benefits, features for protection from data loss, storage terms, hardware components, software components, and network considerations.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
8

# Content Description
This is a digital course with interactive digital labs.

Â 

The IBM Elastic Storage Server (ESS) is a big data storage system that combines Power servers, storage enclosures, and disks along with IBM Spectrum Scale and IBM Spectrum Scale RAID technology, providing analytic and technical computing storage and data services.  
  
This online course provides an overview of the IBM Elastic Storage Server. It reviews benefits, features for protection from data loss, storage terms, hardware components, software components, and network considerations.

Â 

The course details the monitoring tasks to manage the Elastic Storage Server environment including working with the command line interface, working with graphical user interface, and to manage both file systems and filesets. It also reviews ESA support, disk replacement procedures, update procedures, and the data collection and contact procedures for IBM service and support.
