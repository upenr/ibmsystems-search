# Short Summary
This course is designed for application programmers and beginning system programmers who code, maintain, and debug application support programs or subroutines written in S/390 assembler language.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
32

# Content Description
This course provides instruction and practice in the use of the more complex S/390 Assembler Language facilities for the experienced assembler language programmer. The course includes a discussion of standard linkage conventions, use of BSAM/QSAM and selected system macros, the macro definition language, and reentrant coding considerations.


Emphasis is placed on enhancing skills in problem resolution through analysis of more complex system-provided dumps.



# Objectives
* Identify data management considerations and access methods
* Code assembler language programs which:
	+ Conform to standard linkage conventions using save area chaining
	+ Define and use BSAM/QSAM datasets through standard I/O macros
* Define and execute user macros which contain:
	+ Positional and/or keyword parameters
	+ Fixed or variable entry parameter lists
	+ Conditional assembly logic
* Use variable length storage operations (that is, EX, MVCL, and so on)
* Employ more complex instructions (that is, TR, TRT, BXLE, and so on)
* Access JCL parameter data
* Employ LE date/time handling services
* Identify reentrant coding considerations and dynamic storage acquisition
