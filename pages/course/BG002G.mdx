# Content Description
<p>This exercise will guide you to load and initialize your AES master keys. You will use the ICSF panels for the procedure to do an initial Master key LOAD. You will Load the AES master keys to all your defined co-processors and initialize the CKDS (and optionally PKDS), making them the active key data sets. You will then re-start ICSF, and use the ICSF co-processor management application to verify that the AES master is loaded and active.</p>

# Objectives
<ul><li>Load your AES master key using ICSF&nbsp;<br/>(optionally RSA and DES)&nbsp;</li><li>Initialize your CKDS with the new AES master Key registers&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;(optionally initialize your PKDS with the new RSA master Key register)&nbsp;</li><li>Start ICSF&nbsp;</li><li>Verify that the AES master key is active (optionally RSA and DES)&nbsp;</li><li>Use the health checker to validate the environment</li></ul>
