# Short Summary
This is an intermediate course for IMS database administrators and application developers, who have responsibility for the integrity of IMS databases.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
16

# Content Description
<p>Learn the details of the internal structure of Information Management System (IMS) Databases. Information on the content of segment prefixes will be covered for IMS Databases types that contain pointers including: Full Function Hierarchical Direct (HD), High Availability Large Database (HALDB), and Fast Path. Identify potential types of Database corruption, and strategies for correcting the corruption.</p>

<p>Reinforce the skills you have learned with machine labs.</p>

<p>This course is taught in a web conference medium with live instructor audio, and internet web conferenced materials. Students have chat type Q and A ability, plus live audio. The course is taught 10-12 Central Time and 1- 3 Central Time for 4 work days. Since the class is taught live using web conferencing methods, you can attend from your home or work.</p>

<p>Students will be contacted the week prior to class start and will receive connection information, hardcopy student materials and any other relevant information.</p>
