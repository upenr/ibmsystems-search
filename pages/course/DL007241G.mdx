# Short Summary
This intermediate-level course is provided for system programmers and application programmers to learn how the z/TPF system processes and manages transactional work.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
7

# Content Description
The course contains 6 units:Â 

**Unit 1: A single ECB running on one I-stream**This unit describes how the z/TPF system manages a single ECB running on a system with one I-stream. Â 

**Unit 2: A single ECB running on one I-stream with VFA**Virtual file access (VFA) is a memory cache that the z/TPF system uses to cache database records in local memory. By keeping copies of records in VFA, ECBs can access database records from local memory much faster than reading the records from DASD. This unit describes how the z/TPF system manages a single ECB that runs on a system with one I-stream with VFA. Â 

**Unit 3: Multiple ECBs running on one I-stream**This unit describes how the z/TPF system manages multiple ECBs that run on a system with one I-stream. Â 

**Unit 4: Record locking and serialization**This unit describes how the z/TPF system manages record locking and serialization. Record locking is a key part of z/TPF application architecture, which allows multiple ECBs to make consistent updates to the z/TPF database without data loss or corruption. Â 

**Unit 5: Multiple ECBs running on multiple I-streams**This unit describes how the z/TPF system manages multiple ECBs running on multiple I-streams. Â 

**Unit 6: CPU-intensive and long-running ECBs**This unit describes how the z/TPF system manages CPU-intensive and long-running ECBs.Â 



# Objectives
By completing this course, a learner will be able to:

* Understand some basic concepts of the z/TPF system
* Understand the CPU loop and how different lists in the loop are used
* Understand how the z/TPF system creates new ECBs for transactional work
* Understand how ECBs give up control and resume processing in various situations, such as reading and writing records, locking and serialization, and time slicing.
