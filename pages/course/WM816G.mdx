# Content Description
<p>This course teaches CICS system programmers how to install, tailor, and administer CICS Transaction Server (TS) for z/OS. You learn to construct, run, and administer a CICS system. You tailor the system by configuring CICS to run applications, defining transactions, programs, files, web services, and other resources that CICS applications need. You administer CICS by using CICS transactions and the CICS Explorer.</p>

<p>The course also provides a thorough introduction to security and recovery concepts that are needed to administer new or existing installations of CICS TS. Topics include resource management, storage management, system control, task management, measurement and problem determination tools, intercommunication services, CICSPlex SM, Cloud, Liberty, DevOps, IBM UrbanCode Deploy, DB2, IBM MQ, DBCTL, and more. You practice your new skills on a z/OS system that is configured specifically for this lab-intensive course.</p>
