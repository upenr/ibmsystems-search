# Content Description
<p>This course is designed to teach you how to use z/OS job control language (JCL) and selected z/OS utility programs in an online batch environment. Both Storage Management Subsystem (SMS) and non-SMS JCL are discussed. Machine lab exercises complement the lecture material.</p>

# Objectives
<ul>
	<li>Code basic JCL statements using proper syntax and coding rules, including JCL for:
	<ul>
		<li>Creating new data sets</li>
		<li>Referencing existing data sets</li>
		<li>Condition code testing</li>
		<li>IF/THEN/ELSE/ENDIF constructs</li>
		<li>Generation data groups</li>
		<li>Output routing</li>
		<li>JCL enhancements introduced by various releases of Multiple Virtual Storage (MVS), OS/390, and z/OS</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Identify Storage Management Subsystem requirements</li>
	<li>Code instream and cataloged procedures</li>
	<li>Use symbolic parameters in procedures</li>
	<li>Code procedure overrides and additions super</li>
	<li>Use selected utility programs</li>
	<li>Describe tape processing facilities</li>
	<li>Code sort and merge control statements and associated JCL statements</li>
	<li>Recognize and resolve common abnormal terminations (ABENDs)</li>
</ul>
