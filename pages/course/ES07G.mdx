# Content Description
This course is designed to teach you how to use z/OS job control language (JCL) and selected z/OS utility programs in an online batch environment. Both Storage Management Subsystem (SMS) and non-SMS JCL are discussed. Machine lab exercises complement the lecture material.



# Objectives
* Code basic JCL statements using proper syntax and coding rules, including JCL for:
	+ Creating new data sets
	+ Referencing existing data sets
	+ Condition code testing
	+ IF/THEN/ELSE/ENDIF constructs
	+ Generation data groups
	+ Output routing
	+ JCL enhancements introduced by various releases of Multiple Virtual Storage (MVS), OS/390, and z/OS


* Identify Storage Management Subsystem requirements
* Code instream and cataloged procedures
* Use symbolic parameters in procedures
* Code procedure overrides and additions super
* Use selected utility programs
* Describe tape processing facilities
* Code sort and merge control statements and associated JCL statements
* Recognize and resolve common abnormal terminations (ABENDs)
