# Content Description
This course covers the Â IBM System Storage Virtualization Engine TS7700 and architecture, implementation and operation of the IBM System Storage TS4500 Tape Library. It also provides an overview of tape drives with support for open systems and mainframe environments. With this course, the student will be able to understand the relative concepts for high availability, capacity on demand, advanced library management system, LTO tape cartridges, and 3592 tape cartridges.At the end of this course, it examines the characteristics of the supported tape drives and gives only the main information about resources and cartridges. The student will have recognized features such as the linear tape file system, WORM, encryption and compression.
