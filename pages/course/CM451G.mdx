# Content Description
<p>Learn the details of the use of Information Management System (IMS) utilizes that provide for Database Recoverability. The utilities covered in this class are those that are included with IMS for use with Full Function Databases. Reinforce the skills you have learned with machine labs.</p>

# Objectives
<ul><li>Describe the backup and recovery processing functions related to IMS Full Function databases.
</li><li>Learn the details of the functions and operation of the following IMS utilities, and run laboratory exercises to practice their use:
<ul><li>IMS Image Copy
</li><li>IMS Recovery
</li><li>IMS Change Accumulation
</li><li>IMS Batch Backout
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Understand what processing an IMS Online System &quot;Control Region&quot; must performs in order to provide database integrity following an application or software failure.
</li><li>Identify the situations in which a manual recovery of IMS databases may be required and practice the use of these manuals recovery steps in a laboratory exercise.</li></ul>
