# Short Summary
This course teaches how to write and work with CL programs. CL is abbreviation for control language. 

# Duration in Hours âŒš
32

# Content Description
<p>Learn to write easy to use and efficient control language (CL) programs which may be used to perform a variety of system and application control functions. You are taught to write basic and intermediate level, interactive, and batch CL programs, user commands, and CL programs that function as user tools (programs that use the output of display commands as input).</p>

<p>You will learn to write Control Language (CL) programs which may be used to perform a variety of system and application control functions. You will be taught to write basic and intermediate level interactive and batch CL programs as well as programs that function as user tools (programs that use the output of display commands as input).</p>

# Objectives
<ul />
	<li />Create CL programs that incorporate the full range of language operations and functions:
	<ul />
		<li />Arithmetic, string, and boolean expressions
		<li />Relational operations
		<li />Built-in functions
		<li />File handling
		<li />Message handling
		<li />Retrieving IBM i information
		<li />Program interaction and parameter passing
	
	


<ul />
	<li />Use the interactive source debugging facilities of STRDBG
	<li />Describe how to create and call Integrated Language Environment (ILE) modules, programs, and service programs
	<li />Create user-defined commands with and without parameters
	<li />Create a control language program that processes a database file
	<li />Create and invoke a program that is activated periodically and executes asynchronously from other jobs
	<li />State the purpose of the parameters on the CRTBNDCL command and each section of the control language compiler listing
