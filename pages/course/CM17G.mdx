# Duration in Hours âŒš
24

# Content Description
<p>Learn how to write application programs that use Data Language One (DL/I) to process Information Management System (IMS) databases.</p>

# Objectives
<ul />
	<li />Describe the basic differences between files and IMS databases as they relate to application program coding and logic
	<li />Describe the terms and processing characteristics of IMS hierarchic data structures
	<li />Construct DL/I calls for either COBOL or PL/I language programs
	<li />Write, test and debug a batch application program that uses the DL/I call functions
	<li />Use the IMS Test Program to prototype application program calls, and to perform ad-hoc read and update access to an IMS database
	<li />Describe the applications and uses of other DL/I features
	<li />Program for recovery and restart using DL/I calls to establish synchronization points
	<li />Describe the functions provided by High Availability Large Database (HALDB), and any program differences when accessing a Full Function database or a HALDB
