# Content Description
<p>IBM Spectrum Protect, formerly known as IBM Tivoli Storage Manager, is a data backup and recovery solution designed to help you manage your data retention, reduce the cost of storage, and provide appropriate recovery point objectives to meet any service level agreement. IBM Spectrum Protect offers improved efficiency and flexibility using object-based data management, policy driven retention, and an easy to use interface, the Operations Center. In this advanced-level course, you streamline your daily operations by implementing the latest features, such as inline data deduplication using storage containers, secure communications, and node replication.
