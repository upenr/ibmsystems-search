# Content Description
<p>Blockchain is an emerging technology pattern that can radically improve banking, supply-chain, and other transaction networks, creating new opportunities for innovation.Blockchain technology offers exciting possibilities to radically improve transactions networks, enabling innovations for asset transfer while reducing the cost and risk. Blockchain technology provides the basis for a dynamic shared ledger that can be applied to save time when recording transactions between parties, remove costs associated with intermediaries, and reduce risks of fraud and tampering. All industries can benefit from this technology, from manufacturing to finance and intellectual property.</p>

<p>Blockchain is a technology for a new generation of transactional applications that establishes trust, accountability and transparency, while streamlining business processes. The blockchain network was first introduced by bitcoin, but its practical uses extend far beyond cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>

<p>This 3.0-day course teaches you what blockchain is and why it is important. You will learn the fundamentals of blockchain and how this technology will revolutionize transactions and business networks.</p>

<p>In this course, you learn about the key architectural components that are specific to the Hyperledger Fabric project and how they interact to provide a foundation for a business blockchain network.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hands-on labs in this course show you how to deploy an Hyperledger network Fabric, how to create a working chaincode, deploy it to a blockchain network running on linux on z Systems (or Linuxone), and run some simple tests with it.</p>
