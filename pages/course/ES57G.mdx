# Short Summary
This is an intermediate course for people who need to write and maintain Rexx programs in the z/OS system environment. 

# Duration in Hours âŒš
36

# Content Description
This course is designed to teach you the basic skills required to write programs using the REXX language in z/OS. The course covers the TSO extensions to REXX and interaction with other environments such as the MVS console, running REXX in batch jobs, and compiling REXX.



# Objectives
* Write programs using the Rexx language
* Use various data parsing techniques
* Use built-in Rexx functions
* Create user-defined internal and external functions and subroutines
* Issue host commands from within Rexx execs
* Code programs that read and write data sets
* Use instructions and commands that manipulate the data stack
* Use Rexx debugging tools
* Write error-handling routines
