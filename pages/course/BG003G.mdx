# Short Summary
This exercise will guide you to load and initialize your AES master keys. You will use the ICSF panels for the procedure to do an initial Master key LOAD. You will Load the AES master keys to all your

# Duration in Hours âŒš

# Content Description
<p>In this exercise, you will learn how to change your Master Key using ICSF.&nbsp;<br/>Changing the master keys consists of:&nbsp;<br/>1.Loading the new master key registers on all coprocessors on all member of the sysplexsharing the active CKDS.&nbsp;<br/>2.Allocating a new CKDS.&nbsp;<br/>3.Re-enciphering the CKDS.&nbsp;<br/>4.Setting the master keys and making the reenciphered CKDS the active CKDS.</p>

# Objectives
<ul><li>Load the new master key registers on all coprocessors&nbsp;</li><li>Allocate a new CKDS.&nbsp;</li><li>Reencipher the CKDS.&nbsp;</li><li>Initiate a Coordinated CKDS Master Key Change.&nbsp;</li><li>Set the master keys and make the reenciphered CKDS the active CKDS.</li></ul>
