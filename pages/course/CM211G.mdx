# Short Summary
System programmers responsible for the performance of a large-scale IMS DB/DC system

# Duration in Hours âŒš

# Content Description
<p>This is an online course. Please do not make travel arrangements for this course.</p>

<p>After you receive confirmation that you are enrolled, you will be sent further instructions to access audio, video and remote labs.</p>

<p>This course of 6 sessions, 4 hours each day, teaches a &nbsp;methodology to tune a large-scale z/OS IMS/TM data communication system. Specifically, this course explains the impact of&nbsp;user-specified options on IMS performance, how to determine performance bottlenecks by interpreting information from certain performance reports, and how to implement a plan to improve the&nbsp;performance of an IMS system.</p>

# Objectives
<ul>
	<li>Create and implement a performance improvement plan based on the methodology presented</li>
	<li>Discuss the performance options available to the IMS user</li>
	<li>Describe the performance impact of the IMS storage pools and data sets and their interrelationships</li>
	<li>Interpret the information contained in performance reports</li>
	<li>Analyze the performance reports to determine performance&nbsp;bottlenecks in the IMS system</li>
</ul>

# Agenda
