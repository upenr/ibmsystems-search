# Content Description
<p><strong>This is a self paced course with lab demonstration videos.</strong></p>

<p>IBM Cloud PowerVC Manager, an Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) offering, provides a self-service cloud portal for IBM Power Systems and is built on OpenStack. OpenStack is a collection of open source software projects that enterprises or service providers can use to setup and run their cloud compute and storage infrastructure. IBM Cloud PowerVC Manager provides an easy way to provision and manage virtual machines on IBM PowerVM based systems in a private or hybrid cloud setting. It comes in two versions, a standard edition and a cloud edition.</p>

<p>This course aims to provide an overall understanding of how to install and configure IBM PowerVC Standard Edition and IBM Cloud PowerVC Manager, in an environment with HMC and NovaLink.</p>

<p>Students will learn everything from the basics of installing IBM PowerVC to performing advanced administrative tasks. The course will also attempt to clarify the concepts involved in planning, deploying and implementing IBM Cloud PowerVC Manager and NovaLink. It will cover the basics of cloud computing from a technology standpoint as it is today, the product architectures of IBM Cloud PowerVC Manager and NovaLink, explain their benefits while showing how to implement the products.</p>
