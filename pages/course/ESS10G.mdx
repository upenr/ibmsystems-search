# Short Summary
Pervasive encryption course with hands-on labs, key to IBM security portfolio 

# Duration in Hours âŒš

# Content Description
<p>Organizations are compelled to find effective and cost-efficient data security solutions.</p><p>Encryption is one of the technologies that enables organizations to reduce the cost, impact and even likelihood of a breach. Encrypting data can help companies meet the stringent mandates of the GDPR, HIPAA and other mandates.</p><p>IBM z15 has been designed for pervasive encryption, enabling organizations to encrypt 100% of an organizationâ€™s IBM Z critical business data in-flight and at-rest, with no application changes and no impact to SLAs. Encrypting only the data required to meet compliance mandates should be considered a minimum threshold, not a best practice. IBM z15 makes pervasive encryption the new standard in data protection and the foundation of a larger data security and protection strategy.</p><p>z/OS is designed to provide new policy-based encryption options that take full advantage of the improvements in the z15 platform. These new capabilities include:</p><p>Data set encryption, which is one aspect of pervasive encryption, provides enhanced data protection for many z/OS data sets gives users the ability to encrypt data without needing to make changes to applications to embed encryption APIs within applications.</p><p>New z/OS policy controls which make it possible to use pervasive encryption to protect user data and simplify the task of compliance for many z/OS data sets, zFS file systems, and Coupling Facility structures.</p><p>Pervasive encryption for IBM ZÂ® is a consumable approach to enable extensive encryption of data in-flight and at-rest to substantially simplify encryption and reduce costs associated with protecting data.</p><p>In this course you will learn how to implement Pervasive Encryption in your z/OS installation. The course explores in detail, the various technologies that are involved in z System and z/OS Cryptographic Services, ICSF, RACF and DFSMS access method Services.</p><p>In the hands-on exercises, you begin with the setup of your hardware crypto environment (CCA crypto express and CPACF), then you will load and activate your AES master keys, setup ICSF and its Key datasets (CKDS PKDS TKDS), then define your data encryption keys, activate your data set encryption policy, and encrypt your data sets and zFS filesystems.</p><p>These exercises reinforce the concepts and technologies being covered in the lectures.</p>
