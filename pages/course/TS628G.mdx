# Content Description
IBM Spectrum Protect, formerly known as IBM Tivoli Storage Manager, is a data backup and recovery solution designed to help you manage your data retention, reduce the cost of storage, and provide appropriate recovery point objectives to meet any service level agreement. IBM Spectrum Protect offers improved efficiency and flexibility using object-based data management, policy-driven retention, and an easy to use interface, the Operations Center.

In this advanced-level course, you streamline your daily operations with the latest features, such as using Retention Sets for data retention, and using the Web Client 2.0 to restore data. You use the Operations Center and administrative command line to manage multiple IBM Spectrum Protect servers and nodes. This course also includes scripting, performance tuning, restoring the database and storage, and an overview of integration with IBM Spectrum Protect Plus 10.1.6. The hands-on exercises are performed on two Windows 2016 R2 virtual machines.

This course is the second in a two-course series. It is for storage administrators familiar with the daily management of IBM Spectrum Protect, and focuses on the latest features, such as container pool storage. Basic concepts and installation are not covered in this course. TS618G, the first course in the series, IBM Spectrum Protect 8.1.9 Implementation and Administration, covers basic administration and installation.
