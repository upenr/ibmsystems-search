# Content Description
<p>â€¢ z/OS Container Extensions (zCX), a new entitled capability of z/OS 2.4, ushers in a new era of<br />hybrid computing supporting running Linux applications directly on z/OS.<br />&nbsp;</p><p>â€¢ IBMÂ® z/OSÂ® Container Extensions (IBM zCX) makes it possible to run Linux on IBM ZÂ®<br />applications that are packaged as Docker container images on z/OS. Application developers can<br />develop and data centers can operate popular open source packages, Linux applications, IBM<br />software, and third-party software together with z/OS applications and data.<br />&nbsp;</p>

# Objectives
<p>- Describe the components of z/OS Container Extensions (zCX)<br />- Plan the resources required to setup zCX<br />- Configure and implement a zCX instance with z/OSMF workflow<br />- Start and connect to your zCX instance<br />- Access your zCX CLI Container and issue Docker commands<br />- Provision and deploy application container using zCX docker CLI<br />- Create Docker volumes for data persistence<br />- Monitor and manage your zCX instance and your containers<br />- Deploy some use-case applications in zCX containers<br />- Understand the Security considerations for zCX and containers<br />- Setup zCX user management and authentication<br />- Implement clustering and orchestration of zCX instances and container<br />- Understand how to to Dockerize your Applications for z/OS Container Extensions<br />- Implement a zCX private secure registry to deploy your own containers<br />- Position zCX in the world of Hybrid Cloud<br />- Select workloads for zCX<br />- Determine which application is a good fit for zCX<br />- Describe some zCX use-cases</p>

# Agenda
<p>- In this course we will learn the capabilities and benefits of zCX.<br />- You will plan, configure and implement a zCX instance with z/OSMF workflows<br />- You will learn how to use z/OSMF to setup and configure zCX<br />- Create, provisioning, and deploying a zCX instance<br />- Use z/OSMF workflows to manage the lifecycle of a zCX instance, deprovision a zCX instance<br />- Use reconfiguration workflow to increase/decrease resources for zCX instance<br />- Using zCX Command Line Interface, you will<br />- Get familiar with the docker CLI<br />- Explore installing zCX containers within newly provisioned zCX instance<br />- provision and deploy application containers using zCX docker CLI commands<br />- Explore how to cluster zCX applications for higher availability and load balancing<br />- Operationally control zCX<br />- Dockerize your Applications for z/OS Container Extensions<br />- Create Docker volumes for data persistence, monitor and manage your zCX instance and containers<br />- Implement a zCX private secure registry to deploy your own containers<br />- Exercises and recorded demos reinforce the concepts and technologies being covered in the lectures.<br />&nbsp;</p>

# Audience
<p>This class is intended for z/OS system programmers and IT specialists in<br />charge of configuring, implementing and deploying zCX under z/OS 2.4<br />- This class is also intended for Application developers who will deploy docker<br />containers in a zCX z/OS container extensions instance</p>
