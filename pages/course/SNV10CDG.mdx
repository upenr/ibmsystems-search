# Short Summary
IBM Spectrum Virtualize represents the software engine of IBM SAN Volume Controller (SVC). This is a series of modules to learn and utilize this software.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
4

# Content Description
<p>IBM Spectrum Virtualize Transparent Cloud Tiering supports creating connections to cloud service providers to store copies of volume data in private or public cloud storage &ndash; freeing up capacity on the system.</p>

<p>This module discusses how transparent cloud tiering features and functions, and how it can help administrators to create point-in-time snapshots of data on the system and then copied and stored on the cloud storage. Thus allowing administrators to restore snapshots from the cloud for disaster recovery purposes.</p>

<p>You will also authenticate Transparent Cloud Tiering on an IBM Spectrum Virtualize system to an OpenStack cloud server, create a cloud snapshot of a volume, and recover the volume snapshot from the cloud.</p>

<p>If you are enrolling in a Self Paced Virtual Classroom or Web Based Training course, before you enroll, please review the Self-Paced Virtual Classes and Web-Based Training Classes on our Terms and Conditions page, as well as the system requirements, to ensure that your system meets the minimum requirements for this course. http://www.ibm.com/training/terms</p>

# Objectives
<p>Upon completion of this course you should be able to:</p><p>Define hybrid cloud storage</p><p>Identify the attributes of transparent cloud tiering</p><p>Characterize the function of the cloud snapshot</p><p>Characterize the function of the cloud snapshot recovery</p><p>Assess the use cases of cloud storage</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

# Agenda
<p>Snapshot to the Cloud</p><p>The exercise component implements Transparent Cloud Tiering using an IBM Spectrum Virtualize system to a OpenStack cloud server, creates a cloud snapshot of a volume, and recovers the volume snapshot from the cloud.<br /><br />Note: This simulation provides guided steps and hints on completing the exercise.</p>

# Audience
<p>This course is for IBM personnel, IBM Business Partners, IT consultants and customers who are assessing and/or planning to deploy IBM System San Volume Controller Storage solutions and are interested in learning more on IBM Spectrum Virtualization.</p>
