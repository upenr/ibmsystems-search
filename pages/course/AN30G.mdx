# Short Summary
System Admin, Tech Support Personnel, and Business Partners will receive an overview of the PowerVM virtualization features in a redundant configuration on POWER processor-based systems.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
40

# Content Description
This course provides an overview of the PowerVM edition's features on POWER processor-based systems. It explains the new features and benefits of virtualization including processor virtualization, Virtual I/O Server, and virtual devices, such as virtual Ethernet, virtual SCSI, and virtual Fibre Channel adapters. Basic and advanced configurations of the Virtual I/O Server and its clients are discussed including various availability options.

Expand your knowledge about PowerVM features that were introduced in *Power Systems for AIX I: LPAR Configuration and Planning (AN11G)*.

This course provides lectures and hands on labs in an instructor lead course environment, either in a face-to-face classroom or in a live virtual classroom environment (ILO - Instructor Led Online).



# Objectives
* Configure virtual SCSI devices that are backed by physical volumes, logical volumes, and optical media devices
* Configure the Optical Media Repository, load a CD image, and use it to install a new AIX partition
* Configure virtual Fibre channel devices using NPIV technology
* Configure Ethernet link aggregation for load balancing and backup channel in the VIOS
* Configure Shared Ethernet adapter failover and load sharing
* Configure vNIC failover
* Perform Virtual I/O Server maintenance operations

# Prerequisites
You must have advanced system administration experience with AIX 6 **or** AIX 7. This prerequisite can be met by attending one of the following courses:

*Power Systems for AIX II: Implementation and Administration (AN12G)*

*Power Systems for AIX III: Advanced Administration and Problem Determination (AN15G)*

*AIX Jumpstart for UNIX Professionals (AN14G)*

Alternatively, you must have equivalent AIX **and** LPAR skills.

General TCP/IP knowledge is strongly recommended.

You are also expected to have logical partition administration skills on Power Systems servers, which can be obtained by attending *Power Systems for AIX I: LPAR Configuration and Planning (AN11G)*.
