# Short Summary
System Admin, Tech Support Personnel, and Business Partners will receive an overview of the PowerVM virtualization features in a redundant configuration on POWER processor-based systems.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
40

# Content Description
<p>This course provides an overview of the PowerVM edition's features on POWER processor-based systems. It explains the new features and benefits of virtualization including processor virtualization, Virtual I/O Server, and virtual devices, such as virtual Ethernet, virtual SCSI, and virtual Fibre Channel adapters. Basic and advanced configurations of the Virtual I/O Server and its clients are discussed including various availability options.</p><p>Expand your knowledge about PowerVM features that were introduced in <i>Power Systems for AIX I: LPAR Configuration and Planning (AN11G)</i>.</p><p>This course provides lectures and hands on labs in an instructor lead course environment, either in a face-to-face classroom or in a live virtual classroom environment (ILO - Instructor Led Online).</p>

# Objectives
<ul /><li />Configure virtual SCSI devices that are backed by physical volumes, logical volumes, and optical media devices&nbsp;<li />Configure the Optical Media Repository, load a CD image, and use it to install a new AIX partition<li />Configure virtual Fibre channel devices using NPIV technology<li />Configure Ethernet link aggregation for load balancing and backup channel in the VIOS<li />Configure Shared Ethernet adapter failover and load sharing<li />Configure vNIC failover<li />Perform Virtual I/O Server maintenance operations
