# Short Summary
This exercise will guide you to setup and start ICSF.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
1.5

# Content Description
<p>This exercise will guide you to setup and start ICSF. You will customize the CSFPRMxx installation options, initialize your key datasets (CKDS and PKDS) and start ICSF. In order to run ICSF, there are also a number of system related tasks that must be run, including RACF definitions.</p>

# Objectives
<ul><li>Configure ICSF procedure and parameter options&nbsp;</li><li>Start ICSF&nbsp;</li><li>Allocate and initialize your CKDS&nbsp;</li><li>Set up a RACF environment for key generation&nbsp;</li><li>Define and authorize some ICSF resources in the CSFSERV class&nbsp;</li><li>Initialize and load your master keys using PPINIT&nbsp;</li><li>Verified that the AES master key is active (also RSA DES and ECC)&nbsp;</li><li>Validated the crypto environment by running 2 IVPs</li></ul>
