# Short Summary
This basic course is for system programmers with no prior SMP experience who plan to use SMP/E for system and subsystem maintenance and installation.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
36

# Content Description
<p>This course is designed to provide the SMP/E skills needed in the installation and maintenance of optional features and maintenance in the z/OS operating environment. You are taught to define the SMP/E database and invoke SMP/E to add, modify, or replace system elements. The course includes extensive hands-on labs using a current level of SMP/E.</p>

<p>You will get practical experience in the SMP/E tasks involved in installing a z/OS product. Emphasis is on interpreting results of SMP/E processing. SMP/E concepts examined in this course include modification control statements, the consolidated software inventory, zone structure, and error analysis. SMP/E commands such as RECEIVE, APPLY, ACCEPT, RESTORE, REPORT, and LIST are discussed.</p>

<p>You will also learn how to perform automated SMP/E delivery of z/OS and product maintenance over the Internet with an automated SMP/E process that downloads and installs IBM preventive and corrective service over the Internet.</p>

# Objectives
<ul>
	<li>Describe how SMP/E is used as a tool for system maintenance</li>
	<li>Interpret modification control statements in a sample SYSMOD</li>
	<li>Create a consolidated software inventory database to support installation and maintenance requirements</li>
	<li>Use the SMP/E dialogs to install a product and its related service</li>
	<li>Manage exception SYSMOD data</li>
	<li>Describe the use of the primary and secondary data sets required by SMP/E</li>
	<li>Analyze output from SMP/E processing and resolve commonly encountered problems</li>
	<li>Describe the use of the REPORT command to determine software dependencies between zones</li>
	<li>Use the BUILDMCS process to create a function SYSMOD from an installed product and its service</li>
	<li>Use the new SMP/E functions to install software service automatically over the internet
	<ul>
		<li>Implement support for communication server FTP client</li>
		<li>Use the new RECEIVE ORDER command to order and install z/OS maintenance automatically over the Internet</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

# Prerequisites
<p>Required Skills and Knowledge</p>

<ul>
	<li>Use basic JCL statements</li>
	<li>Describe the use of the following z/OS utility programs: assembler, linkage editor, IEBCOPY, IEBUPDTE, and AMASPZAP</li>
	<li>Identify the access method services commands <strong>and</strong> parameters used in creating a VSAM KSDS</li>
	<li>Use ISPF/PDF panels</li>
</ul>

<p>This knowledge and these skills can be acquired on the job or by completing one <strong>or </strong>more of the following education offerings:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Fundamental Practical System Skills in z/OS , (ES10) (ES10A) </em></li>
	<li><em>z/OS VSAM and Access Method Services, (SS83) (H3840)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The students new to z/OS could benefit from attending <em>z/OS Facilities (ES15) (ES150) </em>for additional basic z/OS knowledge.</p>
