# Short Summary
This basic course is for system programmers with no prior SMP experience who plan to use SMP/E for system and subsystem maintenance and installation.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
36

# Content Description
This course is designed to provide the SMP/E skills needed in the installation and maintenance of optional features and maintenance in the z/OS operating environment. You are taught to define the SMP/E database and invoke SMP/E to add, modify, or replace system elements. The course includes extensive hands-on labs using a current level of SMP/E.


You will get practical experience in the SMP/E tasks involved in installing a z/OS product. Emphasis is on interpreting results of SMP/E processing. SMP/E concepts examined in this course include modification control statements, the consolidated software inventory, zone structure, and error analysis. SMP/E commands such as RECEIVE, APPLY, ACCEPT, RESTORE, REPORT, and LIST are discussed.


You will also learn how to perform automated SMP/E delivery of z/OS and product maintenance over the Internet with an automated SMP/E process that downloads and installs IBM preventive and corrective service over the Internet.



# Objectives
* Describe how SMP/E is used as a tool for system maintenance
* Interpret modification control statements in a sample SYSMOD
* Create a consolidated software inventory database to support installation and maintenance requirements
* Use the SMP/E dialogs to install a product and its related service
* Manage exception SYSMOD data
* Describe the use of the primary and secondary data sets required by SMP/E
* Analyze output from SMP/E processing and resolve commonly encountered problems
* Describe the use of the REPORT command to determine software dependencies between zones
* Use the BUILDMCS process to create a function SYSMOD from an installed product and its service
* Use the new SMP/E functions to install software service automatically over the internet
	+ Implement support for communication server FTP client
	+ Use the new RECEIVE ORDER command to order and install z/OS maintenance automatically over the Internet


# Agenda

# Prerequisites
Required Skills and Knowledge


* Use basic JCL statements
* Describe the use of the following z/OS utility programs: assembler, linkage editor, IEBCOPY, IEBUPDTE, and AMASPZAP
* Identify the access method services commands **and** parameters used in creating a VSAM KSDS
* Use ISPF/PDF panels


This knowledge and these skills can be acquired on the job or by completing one **or** more of the following education offerings:


* *Fundamental Practical System Skills in z/OS , (ES10) (ES10A)*
* *z/OS VSAM and Access Method Services, (SS83) (H3840)*


The students new to z/OS could benefit from attending *z/OS Facilities (ES15) (ES150)* for additional basic z/OS knowledge.
