# Content Description
WebSphere Application Server (WAS) Version 8.5 (V8) for z/OS provides a Java2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) runtime environment for Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), along with servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP) in web applications.


WAS V8 extends the platform established in WebSphere for z/OS V7, bringing new functionality for application management, and new flexible management and administration options.


Learn how to install and customize WebSphere V8.5 for z/OS, and how to deploy EJB applications and web applications. Reinforce the concepts you learn in lectures with extensive hands-on laboratory exercises.


**Note:** This course does not address Java application development for z/OS, and it and does not teach the use of programming tools such as IBM Rational Application Developer V8.



# Objectives
* Understand the basics of object-oriented applications, EJBs and the J2EE standard runtime environment
* Prepare the base z/OS environment, including all system prerequisites
* Plan for and configure the WAS V8.5 runtime environment using the supplied WebSphere Customization Tools (WCT) workstation application
* Design and implement a complete server security scheme for WAS V8.5 on your z/OS system
* Customize your WAS V8.5 runtime on z/OS
* Set up and run the Installation Verification Test (IVT)
* Deploy an EJB application and a web application into your new WAS V8.5 runtime using the systems management administrative functions
* Configure and manage network deployment, including a deployment manager and node agents
* Configure web-based topologies for WAS V8.5 using the IBM HTTP server on z/OS together with the WebSphere plug-in
* Install and configure an the Apache-based web server on z/OS to host the WebSphere for z/OS plug-in
* Configure and use a web server node in WebSphere to assist managing the web server plug-in file
* Create a cluster by cloning your first application server
* See how the plug-in can perform load balancing and achieve high availability
* Create a proxy server, and drive your applications through this proxy server
* Define a JDBC driver and data source and deploy a sample application to connect to a DB2 for z/OS subsystem through the UDB universal driver type 4
* Describe the main components and infrastructure of the WebSphere for z/OS Java messaging run time environment
* Plan for the monitoring of performance in your new WAS V8.5 runtime
* Plan for the modification of the installation security configuration necessary to support J2EE application security
* Set up and configure a Liberty profile server, then deploy an application

# Audience
This advanced course is for experienced z/OS system programmers responsible for the installation and customization of WAS V8, along with Information Technology (IT) professionals responsible for the deployment of EJB and web applications into WAS V8 on z/OS.


Teams of two or three individuals from an enterprise are recommended to attend. Teams should include the z/OS system programmer responsible for the installation of WAS V8, an application assembler responsible for deploying EJB and web applications, and possibly a WAS specialist. The range of skills needed for deploying WebSphere eBusiness applications is such that it is rare for one IT professional to have expertise in all areas of WebSphere.

# Prerequisites
You should have:


* Experience with the installation **and** customization of z/OS and its subsystems, including WLM, TCP/IP, UNIX Services, **and** the Security Server (Resource Access Control Facility (RACF)), **or** equivalent product.


This course, just as the WAS V8 product does, assumes that the initial z/OS infrastructure basics have already been implemented, including WLM Goal Mode, Resource Recovery Services (RRS), **and** the System Logger. The basic implementation of these z/OS subsystems **or** functions are not covered in this course. Individuals who need training in the implementation of the prerequisite subsystems **and** functions should consider completing other appropriate courses in the curriculum prior to attending this course.
