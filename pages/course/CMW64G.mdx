# Content Description
<p>Learn the features and functions of Information Management System (IMS) Fast Path from both a capability perspective and an implementation perspective.</p>

<p>There is something in this course for all Information Technology (IT) professionals, including applications, systems, and database practitioners. The instructor assumes that you already have an understanding of IMS Database / Transaction Manager (DB/TM) fundamentals and that the information presented here builds upon that knowledge.</p>

<p>This course is taught in a Web conference medium with live instructor audio and Internet Web conferenced materials. You have chat type Questions and Answers (Q&amp;A) ability, plus live audio. The course is taught 10 a.m. to 12 noon and 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. Central Time for nine work days. Since the class is taught live using Web conferencing methods, you can attend from your home or workplace. Class durations are approximately one-half day so you can still accommodate daily work responsibilities.</p>

<p>You will be contacted the week prior to class start to receive connection information, hardcopy student materials, and any other relevant information.</p>

# Objectives
<ul />
	<li />Identify the components of IMS Fast Path
