# Short Summary
System Admin or anyone implementing and managing an AIX operating system will learn to install, customize, and administer the AIX operating system in a multiuser Power Systems partitioned environment.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
40

# Content Description
<p>Learn to install, customize, and administer the AIX operating system in a multiuser Power Systems partitioned environment. The course is based on AIX 7.2 running on a Power Systems server managed by Hardware Management Console and provides practical discussions that are appropriate to earlier AIX releases.</p>

# Objectives
<ul /><li />Install the AIX operating system, filesets, and RedHat Package Manager (RPM) packages<li />Perform system startup and shutdown<li />Discuss and use system management tools such as System Management Interface Tool (SMIT)<li />Manage physical and logical devices<li />Discuss the purpose of the logical volume manager<li />Perform logical volume and file system management<li />Create and manage user and group accounts<li />Perform and restore system backups<li />Utilize administrative subsystems, including cron to schedule system tasks, and security to implement customized access of files and directories<li />Configure TCP/IP networking<li />Configure and conduct Live Kernel Updates on a running AIX LPAR

# Prerequisites
<p>You should already be able to:</p><ul /><li />Log in to an AIX system and set a user password<li />Execute basic AIX commands<li />Manage files and directories<li />Use the vi editor<li />Use redirection, pipes, and tees<li />Use the utilities find and grep<li />Use the command and variable substitution<li />Set and change Korn shell variables<li />Write simple shell scripts<p>These skills can be acquired by attending <i>AIX Basics (AN10G)</i> <strong>or </strong>through equivalent AIX <strong>or </strong>UNIX knowledge. Also, it would be helpful (but not mandatory) if students were familiar with partitioning concepts <strong>and</strong> technology taught in <i>Power Systems for AIX I: LPAR Configuration and Planning (AN11G)</i>.</p>
