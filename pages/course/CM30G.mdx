# Short Summary
This intermediate course is for ndividuals interested in the performance of the IMS Database System. 

# Duration in Hours âŒš
40.0

# Content Description
Learn how to tune Information Management System (IMS) databases for use in IMS/Batch, IMS/Data Communications (DC), CICS-Local-Data Language One (DL/I), and Data Base Control (DBCTL) environments.


Explore the IMS database features that affect performance such as data set considerations and buffers for VSAM and OSAM. You will also practice a method for estimating performance before implementation. Plus, you will reinforce the skills you have learned with seven machine labs.

# Objectives
* Analyze performance data about the IMS database environment
* Choose IMS access methods that provide the best database performance
* Improve performance by selecting database buffer pools and buffer pool options and with the correct data set access method and storage attributes
* Implement the optimum performance options for VSAM data sets at define and execute time
* Evaluate the need for secondary indexes and select implementation options to improve their performance
* Choose physical database implementation options to improve performance
* Select HDAM randomizing parameters that can improve the key randomization process

# Prerequisites
You should complete:


* *IMS Physical Organization of Databases Workshop (U3722)*


**or** have four to six months experience with the IMS database system.


For additional prerequisites visit our Web site and search on U3720.


* Describe the physical storage and processing characteristics of Hierarchial Indexed Sequential Access Method (HISAM), Hierarchial Indexed Direct Access Method (HIDAM), and Hierarchial Direct Access Method (HDAM) access methods.
* Code the Data Base Definitions (DBD) and Program Specification Blocks (PSB) macros to implement secondary indexing, HISAM, HIDAM, and HDAM physical databases.
* Describe the physical storage characteristics of secondary indexes.
* Describe the PSB and programming requirements and processing characteristics when using a secondary index.
* Use the IMS utilities to load and reorganize logically related databases with secondary indexes.
* Use Virtual Storage Access Method (VSAM)s access method services to delete and define the Key-Sequenced Data Set (KSDS) and Entry-Sequenced Data Set (ESDS) data sets needed to support the database environment.
* Use reports created by the database tool's program, DBD/PSB/ACB MapperSpecify buffers for VSAM data set supported databases
