# Short Summary
This exercise will guide you to load and initialize your AES master keys. You will use the ICSF panels for the procedure to do an initial Master key LOAD. You will Load the AES master keys to all your

# Duration in Hours âŒš
1.5

# Content Description
<p>In this exercise, you will learn how to encrypt datasets. To create an encrypted data set, you must assign a key label to the data set when it is newly allocated (data set create). A key label can be supplied in any of the following (using order of precedence as follows):&nbsp;</p><ul><li>RACF Data set profile the Data Facility Product (DFP) segment&nbsp;</li><li>JCL, Dynamic Allocation, TSO Allocate, IDCAMS DEFINE&nbsp;</li><li>Storage Management Subsystem (SMS) Construct: Data Class&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;</li></ul>

# Objectives
<ul><li>Protect data sets with secure keys&nbsp;</li><li>Create encrypted data sets&nbsp;</li><li>Encrypt datasets (new and existing)&nbsp;</li><li>Decrypt datasets&nbsp;</li><li>Access encrypted data sets &nbsp;</li><li>Manage encrypted datasets (transmit, dump, restore, copy,...)&nbsp;</li><li>Performed key rotation of encrypted dataset</li></ul>
