# Short Summary
This course teaches perf. monitoring skills for Suse Enterprise Linux, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and Ubuntu server on a Power8 Systems.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
24

# Content Description
<p>This course is designed to teach performance monitoring skills for SUSE LINUX Enterprise Server, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and Ubuntu server on POWER8 servers. This course teaches the skills that are needed to measure, analyze, and potentially tune Linux distributions for optimal performance on IBM POWER8 systems. In this course we focus on the features that relate to performance of the POWER8 processor, Linux kernel, and the special monitoring, configuring, and tuning needs of virtual servers. This course does not cover application monitoring and tuning.</p>

<p>You will work with traditional and IBM provided Linux performance analysis and tuning tools. Our objective is to learn which tools to use, when, and how they have been enhanced for the latest POWER8 technology. These skills are invaluable to individuals responsible for the performance of a POWER8 server.</p>

<p>Each lecture is reinforced with hands-on lab exercises to gain practical experience applicable to your performance management requirements.</p>

# Objectives
<p>On Completion of this course, the student should be able to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Identify the system components to be monitored</li>
	<li>Define a basic performance monitoring strategy for Linux</li>
	<li>Identify open source, and IBM specific tools to monitor:
	<ul>
		<li>Processor</li>
		<li>Memory</li>
		<li>I/O</li>
		<li>Network</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Interpret results and reports generated by standard Linux tools</li>
	<li>Structure a tuning strategy</li>
	<li>Describe features of the POWER8 architecture that are relevant to performance management</li>
	<li>Describe Virtual Server resource configuration guidelines</li>
</ul>
