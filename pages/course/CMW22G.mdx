# Short Summary
This is a basic level course for database administrators, system programmers, and other data administration individuals, who design, implement, and maintain IMS databases.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
32

# Content Description
<p>Learn how to design, implement, reorganize, and recover Information Management System (IMS) databases. Practice these skills in intensive machine labs.</p>

<p>This course uses a Web conference medium with live instructor audio and Internet Web conferenced material. You have chat-type Question and Answer (Q and A) ability, plus live audio. The course is taught 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon and 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. Central time for eight work days over a two-week period.
