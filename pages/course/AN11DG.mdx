# Short Summary
Learn about the features of IBM PowerVM (our hypervisor), and how to start configuring and managing Logical Partitions (LPARs) for AIX using the Hardware Management Console (HMC).

# Duration in Hours âŒš
8

# Content Description
This course introduces system administration concepts in an IBM Power environment. Learn about the features of IBM PowerVM, our hypervisor, and how to start configuring and managing Logical Partitions (LPARs) for AIX using the Hardware Management Console (HMC).

This course will help anyone who wants to use LPARs on IBM Power.



# Objectives
* Describe essential concepts that are associated with managing POWER processor-based systems, such as logical partitioning, dynamic partitioning, virtual processors, virtual consoles, and shared processors
* Describe the functions provided by the HMC
* Configure and manage LPARs by using the HMC graphical user interface (GUI) and HMC commands
* Power on and power off the Power Systems server
