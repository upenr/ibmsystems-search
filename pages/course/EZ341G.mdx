# Content Description
This course teaches z/Architecture machine instructions and Assembler language instructions that a programmer needs to write Assembler application programs.



# Objectives
* Code z/Architecture machine instructions that:
* copy data to/from registers
* perform signed binary integer arithmetic operations
* compare signed binary integers
* perform conditional or unconditional branching
* move or compare characters
* operate on bits
* perform decimal arithmetic operations
* List the Assembler Jump and Branch extended mnemonics
* Understand the role of the PSW condition code
* Understand the role of the PSW program mask
* Format a decimal number for displaying or printing


# Agenda

# Prerequisites
Before taking this course, you should haveÂ completed the courseÂ [z/Architecture Assembler language. Part 1: The basics](https://learn.ibm.com/course/view.php?id=12127).

To complete the labs, you need basic knowledge of TSO/ISPF and JCL. In particular, you should know how to:

* Logon to TSO
* Edit a file with the ISPF editor
* Submit a job
* View a job's output in SDSF

You can learn about TSO/ISPF in the courseÂ [Introduction to z/OS Commands and Panels on IBM Z](https://www.ibm.com/training/badge/introduction-to-z-os-commands-and-panels-on-ibm-z).
