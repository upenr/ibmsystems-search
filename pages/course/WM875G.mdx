# Content Description
<p>This advanced course teaches you how to design, code, test, and debug CICS application programs that use the CICS web services features in CICS Transaction Server V5.</p>

<p>The content of this course is applicable to the entire family of CICS products and is primarily directed toward application developers who are interested in implementing CICS web services. Through a combination of instructor-led lectures and extensive hands-on exercises in COBOL, you learn how to create, test, and debug CICS web services. The course covers topics such as creating and implementing CICS applications as web services and implanting security measures in CICS for web services applications.</p>
