# Short Summary
The primary audience for this intermediate course are z/OS system programmers who are new to z/OS installation, customization, measurement and tuning, or problem determination. Subsystem....

# Duration in Hours âŒš
36

# Content Description
<p>This course presents the structure and control blocks of the z/OS BCP and system services. It prepares the new z/OS system programmer to identify potential bottlenecks and performance problems, perform initial error symptom gathering, and identify opportunities and requirements for tailoring a z/OS system. This course also provides prerequisite information needed for further training in specialized areas such as system measurement and tuning and system problem determination.</p>

# Objectives
<ul>
	<li>Explain the MVS functions and control blocks necessary to support a task in a multitasking and multiprocessing environment</li>
	<li>Describe the software and hardware functions that allow a program to interact with programs running in other address spaces, use data in other address spaces, and use data in data spaces</li>
	<li>Trace the flow of an I/O operation from the initial request in the application program through the completion of data transfer</li>
	<li>Identify the control blocks that describe the current status of an I/O request</li>
	<li>Describe the functions of the z/OS BCP Virtual, Real, and Auxiliary Storage Managers</li>
	<li>Describe the functions performed by the Recovery Termination Manager and recovery management components to minimize failure impact and enhance error correction</li>
	<li>Select the appropriate IBM publication to provide further technical information (SRLs, Technical Bulletins, Self-study and other z/OS courses)</li>
	<li>Describe the services provided by cross system extended services (XES)</li>
	<li>Identify and explain the purpose of the cache, list, and lock structures</li>
	<li>Plan the implementation of the global resource serialization STAR environment.0.2 pref</li>
</ul>

# Prerequisites
<p>You should be able to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Describe the following z/OS BCP (MVS) characteristics:
	<ul>
		<li>multiprocessing</li>
		<li>multiprogramming</li>
		<li>virtual storage <strong>and</strong> paging</li>
		<li><strong>and</strong> multiple address space/data space architecture</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Explain how paging <strong>and</strong> swapping are accomplished through the interaction of real/central, expanded, auxiliary, <strong>and</strong> virtual storage in a z/OS system</li>
	<li>Explain the role of the dispatcher, interrupts, SVCs, the program manager, <strong>and</strong> serialization in managing work in a z/OS system</li>
	<li>State the role of z/OS software <strong>and</strong> hardware components in handling an I/O request for data on a direct access storage device</li>
</ul>

<p>These prerequisites can be met through on the job training <strong>or</strong> completion of z/OS Facilities.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: A fundamental knowledge of hexadecimal notation, assembler language, <strong>and</strong> z/Architecture instruction execution will enhance your understanding of the course material. Completion of Assembler Language Coding Workshop <strong>or</strong> Assembler Language Series is recommended.</p>
