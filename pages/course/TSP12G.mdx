# Changes since last release
* A new classroom VM set for skytap / IRLP
*	A new student exercise guide
*	A change document which describes the fixes/ changes in the course

Here is a list of things that have changed in the student exercises:                                             
*	Disk space increased by 50 GB to prevent low disk space conditions during course execution
*	Gold SLA changed to run daily instead of every 4 hours , again to prevent low disk space conditions
*	Initial password for vSnap and SPP server changed. The old password met production security rules for SPP, but was very difficult to type and not necessary for a temporary lab environment. The new one is much easier to type, particularly on foreign keyboards and is suitable for a lab environment
*	vSnap and SPP server console passwords are now set not to expire
