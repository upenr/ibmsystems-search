# Short Summary
This course is appropriate for system administrators, technical support individuals, and IBM business partners who implement LPARs on IBM Power Systems. 

# Duration in Hours âŒš
24

# Content Description
<p>Learn how to perform system administration in a Power Systems environment. Learn about the features of PowerVM Editions and how to configure and manage LPARs running AIX V7 or Linux using the Hardware Management Console (HMC).</p>

# Objectives
<ul /><li />Describe important concepts that are associated with managing POWER processor-based systems, such as logical partitioning, dynamic partitioning, virtual devices, virtual processors, virtual consoles, virtual local area network (VLAN), and shared processors<li />Describe the features of the PowerVM editions<li />Describe the functions provided by the HMC<li />Configure and manage the HMC, including users and permissions, software, start and shutdown, remote access features, network configuration, security features, HMC backup and restore options, and the HMC reload procedure<li />Describe the rules that are associated with allocating resources, including dedicated processors, processing units for Micro-Partitioning, memory, physical and virtual I/O for AIX and Linux partitions<li />Configure and manage LPARs by using the HMC graphical user interface (GUI) and HMC commands<li />Power on and power off the Power Systems server<li />Use the HMC to back up and restore partition data<li />Perform dynamic LPAR operations (DLPAR)
