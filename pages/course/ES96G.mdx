# Short Summary
This course is for people who are responsible for maintaining the I/O configuration contained in the input/output data files (IODFs) and input/output configuration data sets (IOCDs) at their z/OS...

# Duration in Hours âŒš
32.0

# Content Description
Learn to work with the Hardware Configuration Definition (HCD) function for z/OS, and to plan and initiate dynamic reconfiguration of your zSeries hardware environment. Learn to use the HCD dialogs of z/OS to create an Input/Output (I/O) configuration and dynamically alter the I/O configuration. Learn about the creation of an I/O Configuration Dataset (IOCDS) and various reports that HCD can build. Use a z/OS system to reinforce lecture topics and to practice working with the HCD dialogs. Hands-on lab projects may be done in teams depending on the number of attendees and location.



# Objectives
* Describe new zSeries processor technology
* Code new zSeries processors (z9 to z196)
* Code FICON channels and FICON CTCs
* Code Coupling Facilities (CF) and CF links
* Code cascaded FICON Directors
* Create an IODF work file on a z processor from scratch
* Use CHPID mapping tool to create a validated work IODF
* Use work IODF and create a production IODF
* Perform Dynamic I/O changes on a real z/OS system
* Build a LOADxx parmlib member for initial program load (IPL)
* View configuration graphically
* Create appropriate configuration reports
