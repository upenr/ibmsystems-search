# Short Summary

# Duration in Hours âŒš

# Content Description
<p>Learn to work with the Hardware Configuration Definition (HCD) function for z/OS, and to plan and initiate dynamic reconfiguration of your zSeries hardware environment. Learn to use the HCD dialogs of z/OS to create an Input/Output (I/O) configuration and dynamically alter the I/O configuration. Learn about the creation of an I/O Configuration Dataset (IOCDS) and various reports that HCD can build. Use a z/OS system to reinforce lecture topics and to practice working with the HCD dialogs. Hands-on lab projects may be done in teams depending on the number of attendees and location.</p>

# Objectives

	<li />Code cascaded FICON Directors
	<li />Create an IODF work file on a z processor from scratch
	<li />Use CHPID mapping tool to create a validated work IODF
	<li />Use work IODF and create a production IODF
	<li />Perform Dynamic I/O changes on a real z/OS system
	<li />Build a LOADxx parmlib member for initial program load (IPL)
	<li />View configuration graphically
	<li />Create appropriate configuration reports
