# Content Description
<p>This course broadens the skills of the student who are required to implement and manage a Kubernetes-based Platform as a Service (PaaS) environment based on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on Power Systems. The course covers basic administration and configuration of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform within a POWER processor-based server configured with IBM PowerVC. Hands-on exercises reinforce the lecture material, and allow students to use the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform to work with images, applications, and manage a cluster.</p>
