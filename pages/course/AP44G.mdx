# Short Summary
This course teaches installation & administration then performance management of all three Linux distributions support in Power Systems ecosystem.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
40

# Content Description
<p>This PowerCare course is designed to teach administration and performance management functions for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), and Ubuntu&nbsp;within an IBM Power Systems Running Linux ecosystem.</p>

<p>In the first part of the week students are taught installation, configuration, administration and troubleshooting. Students will also learn command line operations, graphical desktop deployment, device management, IBM tools, and system recovery.</p>

<p>In the last part of the week students learn performance monitoring skills. Students are learn skills needed to measure, analyze, and potentially tune Linux distributions for optimal performance on IBM POWER8 systems. In this course we focus on the features that relate to performance of the POWER8 processor, Linux kernel, and the special monitoring, configuring, and tuning needs of virtual servers. This course does not cover application monitoring and tuning.</p>

<p>You will work with traditional and IBM provided Linux performance analysis and tuning tools. Our objective is to learn which tools to use, when, and how they have been enhanced for the latest POWER8 technology. These skills are invaluable to individuals responsible for the performance of a POWER8 server.</p>

<p>Each lecture is reinforced with hands-on lab exercises to gain practical experience applicable to your performance management requirements.</p>

# Objectives
