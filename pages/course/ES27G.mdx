# Short Summary
This basic course is for IT personnel with little or no theoretical background of z/OS and little or no general practical in IS experience.

# Duration in Hours âŒš

# Content Description
<p>To provide an overview of the z Operating System (OS), look at the systems from both a hardware and software prospective, and develop a basic understanding of System z partitioning capabilities, Processor Resource/Systems Manager (PR/SM), z/OS, Job Entry Subsystem 2 (JES2), Job Entry Subsystem 3 (JES3), Time Sharing Option (TSO), TSO Extended (TSO/E), System Display and Search Facility (SDSF), z/OS Communications Server, and System z channel subsystem usage for various channels, such as Enterprise System Connection (ESCON), Fiber Connector (FICON), and the Open Systems Adapter (OSA). It will also describe the Initial Program Loader (IPL) process and enable you to become comfortable issuing z/OS commands from a Multi Console Support (MCS) system console or extended MCS console.</p>

	<li>Issue z/OS commands with the correct syntax</li>
	<li>Identify z/OS display commands that can be used to determine device and channel path status</li>
	<li>Describe the use of VARY and CONFIG z/OS operator commands</li>
	<li>Interpret the results of z/OS commands</li>
	<li>Identify the differences between JES2 and JES3</li>

	<li>SPOOLs and checkpoint data sets</li>
	<li>Cold, warm, and hot starts</li>
	<li>Commands to control resources and display job status</li>
	<li>Describe the purpose and use of the following:</li>
	<li>TSO</li>
	<li>ISP/PDF</li>
	<li>Allocating, displaying, and editing data set information with ISP/PDF panels</li>
	<li>SDSF</li>
	<li>Describe the naming rules for z/OS data sets</li>
	<li>Describe the z/OS catalog structure</li>
	<li>Describe the functions performed by DFSMS, DFSMSdss, DFSMShsm, and DFSMSrmm to help manage the data sets in a data center</li>
	<li>Describe the function of JCL cataloged procedures</li>
	<li>Identify the difference between MCS consoles and extended MCS consoles</li>
	<li>Issue commands to determine the status and parameters of any console</li>
	<li>Describe major console enhancements at z/OS 1.8, z/OS 1.10, and z/OS 2.1</li>
</ul>
