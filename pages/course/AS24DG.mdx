# Content Description
This introductory course enables a new system operator to develop basic to intermediate level skills needed for day-to-day operations of IBM i. Â Focus is given to using the GUI (IBM i Access Client Solutions and IBM Navigator for i) as well as 5250 emulation sessions to perform tasks including job control, monitoring, sending messages, managing systems devices, and more. Lab demos reinforce the lecture topics and prepare the student to successfully operate IBM i on IBM Power.Â Completion of this course gets you an IBM badge: https://www.credly.com/org/ibm/badge/system-operator-for-ibm-i-foundations.
