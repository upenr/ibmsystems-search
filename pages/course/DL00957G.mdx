# Short Summary
This intermediate course describes how to implement, maintain, and recover IBM IMS High Availability Large Databases. Â Youâ€™ll learn how to migrate databases to HALDB and the advantages of HALDB

# Duration in Hours âŒš
10

# Content Description
A HALDB is a partitioned full-function database. Partitioning a database allows the use of smaller data sets that are easier to manage. Multiple partitions decrease the amount of unavailable data if a partition fails or is taken offline.



# Objectives
You'll learn about HALDB databases and their partitions; database administrator responsibilities in managing HALDB; developing procedures for the support and recovery of HALDB; migrating databases to HALDB; and application design considerations for HALDB.
