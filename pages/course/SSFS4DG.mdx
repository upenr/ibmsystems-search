# Short Summary
This course introduces the IBM FlashSystem A9000, and IBM FlashSystem A9000R.

# Duration in Hours âŒš

# Content Description
<p>The IBM FlashSystem A9000 and IBM FlashSystem A9000R, are all-flash solutions purposely built for cloud-scale business. This course will provide an overview of these storage systems and their distinct components. We will cover an overview of the physical requirements that incorporates the roles of the client, and IBM Support Service Representative, and other tasks needed for the deployment of IBM FlashSystem A9000, and IBM FlashSystem A9000R.<br />
Industry-leading data reduction technology that combines inline, real-time pattern matching and removal, data deduplication, and compression is part of this course. In addition, topics include the definition of systems in the GUI, and the creation of a logical configuration using the physical capacity of the all-flash storage enclosure. This course covers the IBM Hyper-Scale Manager (also known as the HSM) that was developed along with the IBM FlashSystem A9000, and A9000R storage systems. This unique, user interface, IBM Hyper-Scale Manager is not a typical, table-driven interface. It is a fresh approach, to storage management, based on a series of user studies that has helped pinpoint key capabilities, that simplify storage management.</p>
