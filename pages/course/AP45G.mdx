# Short Summary
This course teaches installation & administration then storage management of all three Linux distributions support in Power Systems ecosystem.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
40

# Content Description
<p>This PowerCare course is designed to teach administration and performance management functions for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), and Ubuntu&nbsp;within an IBM Power Systems Running Linux ecosystem.</p>

<p>In the first part of the week students are taught installation, configuration, administration and troubleshooting. Students will also learn command line operations, graphical desktop deployment, device management, IBM tools, and system recovery.</p>

<p>In the last part of the week students learn storage management skills on each of the Linux distributions. Students expand on their Linux administration skills with IBM Power systems, in the area of storage devices. IBM Power Systems provide a large variety of storage options, and combining these options with Linux storage management techniques is a critical skill required by today&rsquo;s system administrator.</p>

<p>Each lecture is reinforced with hands-on lab exercises to gain practical experience applicable to your performance management requirements.</p>

# Objectives
