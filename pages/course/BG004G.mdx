# Short Summary
This exercise will guide you to load and initialize your AES master keys. You will use the ICSF panels for the procedure to do an initial Master key LOAD. You will Load the AES master keys to all your

# Duration in Hours âŒš
1.5

# Content Description
<p>In this exercise, you will learn how to generate secure data keys and use them to create protected keys. You will experiment the different ways to create secure data keys. You will also use the ICSF panels to manage your CKDS records. You will finally validate that ICSF is working as expected by encrypting and decrypting some data.</p>

# Objectives
