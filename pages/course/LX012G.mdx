# Short Summary
This course is designed to teach the basics of the Linux environment.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
24

# Content Description
<p>This course introduces the community-supported Linux distributions that are available for IBM Power systems including Fedora, CentOS, OpenSUSE, and Debian. While these are less common than &ldquo;Enterprise level&rdquo; Linux distributions, they still play a key role in the overall Linux deployment strategy.</p>

<p>This course consists of approximately six hours of instruction, followed by three days of lab exercises and open lab time. During the open lab time, the students will have an opportunity to choose a Linux distribution, install it and then perform common administrative tasks on the assigned IBM Power System. The structured lab exercises will take only a portion of the allotted time, allowing students more time to experiment on their own.</p>

# Objectives
<p>Upon completion of this course, the student should be able to:<br />
- Discuss trends in Linux space<br />
- Describe IBM Power systems<br />
- Introduce the community supported distributions to their organizations<br />
