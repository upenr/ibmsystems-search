# Content Description
Learn all aspects, including installation, implementation, and management of the Database Recovery Control (DBRC) system of Information Management System (IMS). DBRC is an IMS facility that provides database recovery, and facilitates database sharing, between IMS systems in all IMS environments including DB/TM Data Base Control (DBCTL) and Batch. Reinforce the concepts and skills you have learned with machine labs.


This course is taught in a Web conference medium with live instructor audio, and Internet Web conferenced materials. You have chat type Question and Answer (Q and A) ability, plus live audio. The course is taught 10:00 a.m. to 12 noon and 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. Central time for eight work days over a two week period. Since the class is taught live using Web conferencing methods, you can attend from your home or work. Class durations are approximately one-half day so you can still accommodate daily work responsibilities.


**Course Materials**


Course materials will be provided in softcopy format and possibly hardcopy format also. You will receive connection software and usage information.
