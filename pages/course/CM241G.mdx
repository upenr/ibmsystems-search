# Short Summary
People responsible for designing, implementing, maintaining, ortuning IMS databases using logical relationships.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
32

# Content Description
<p>Learn how to successfully implement and tune Information Management System (IMS) databases with IMS logical relationships. Examine in detail the various pointer options. Practice these skills in intensive machine-lab exercises.</p>

# Objectives
<ul>
	<li>Code the DBDs and PSBs for databases involved in logical relationships, including those using recursive data structures</li>
	<li>Use IMS utilities to load and reorganize logically related databases</li>
	<li>Choose logical relationship update rules based upon application processing requirements</li>
	<li>Identify DBD coding parameters that are critical to the performance of logically related databases</li>
	<li>Interpret the results of logical relationship implementation choices using the reports provided by the IMS Monitor</li>
</ul>

# Agenda
<ul><li>Introduction to Logical Relationships</li><li>Unidirectional Logical Relationships</li><li>Unidirectional Logical Data Structures</li><li>Bidirectional Logical Relationships</li><li>Bidirectional Logical Data Structures</li><li>Database Load and Reorganization</li><li>Recursive Structures</li><li>ISRT Rules and Exercise</li><li>Logical Relationship Performance</li><li>Logical Relationship Tuning</li><li>Design and Change Considerations</li></ul>

# Audience
<p>People responsible for designing, implementing, maintaining, or tuning IMS databases using logical relationships.</p>

# Skill Level

# Prerequisites
<p>You should have at least four months of experience using IMS and should be able to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>&bull; Use TSO/ISPF <strong>or</strong> PDF</li>
	<li>&bull; Demonstrate basic knowledge of:
	<ul>
		<li>OS/VS Job Control Language</li>
		<li>VSAM access methods service utilities</li>
		<li>DL/I application programming techniques</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Describe the characteristics<strong> and </strong>storage format of HISAM, HIDAM <strong>and</strong> HDAM databases <strong>and</strong> code their DBDs</li>
	<li>Understand the IMS DB Monitor <strong>and</strong> use its reports to resolve database performance concerns</li>
</ul>

<p>These skills can be developed by attending:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>IMS Physical Organization of Databases Workshop (CM22) </em></li>
	<li><em>IMS Database Performance and Tuning Workshop (CM30)</em></li>
</ul>
