# Short Summary
People responsible for designing, implementing, maintaining, ortuning IMS databases using logical relationships. 

# Duration in Hours âŒš
32

# Content Description
<p>Learn how to successfully implement and tune Information Management System (IMS) databases with IMS logical relationships. Examine in detail the various pointer options. Practice these skills in intensive machine-lab exercises.</p>

# Objectives
<ul />
	<li />Code the DBDs and PSBs for databases involved in logical relationships, including those using recursive data structures
	<li />Use IMS utilities to load and reorganize logically related databases
	<li />Choose logical relationship update rules based upon application processing requirements
	<li />Identify DBD coding parameters that are critical to the performance of logically related databases
	<li />Interpret the results of logical relationship implementation choices using the reports provided by the IMS Monitor


# Agenda

# Prerequisites
<p>You should have at least four months of experience using IMS and should be able to:</p>

<ul />
	<li />&bull; Use TSO/ISPF <strong>or</strong> PDF
	<li />&bull; Demonstrate basic knowledge of:
	<ul />
		<li />OS/VS Job Control Language
		<li />VSAM access methods service utilities
		<li />DL/I application programming techniques
	
	
	<li />Describe the characteristics<strong> and </strong>storage format of HISAM, HIDAM <strong>and</strong> HDAM databases <strong>and</strong> code their DBDs
	<li />Understand the IMS DB Monitor <strong>and</strong> use its reports to resolve database performance concerns


<p>These skills can be developed by attending:</p>

<ul />
	<li /><em>IMS Physical Organization of Databases Workshop (CM22) </em>
	<li /><em>IMS Database Performance and Tuning Workshop (CM30)</em>
