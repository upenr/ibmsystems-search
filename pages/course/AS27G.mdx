# Content Description
<p>This course is designed to enhance the skills of an IBM i System Operator. This course explains the concept of how LPAR works and discusses the functions provided by the HMC. We will discuss the IBM i Access Family of products in general and Access Client Solutions, specifically. We will discuss the different types of security that you can implement in order to control who has access to your data and what they can do with that data if they are allowed to access. We will discuss security control via system values, user and group profiles, authorization lists, and adopted authority. This course will help you develop additional skills in the areas of work management and how to create a basic CL program. In the area of CL programming, we discuss concepts of programming, then how to create a basic CL program using the traditional application development tools PDM and SEU. Then, you will learn how to use the GUI tools in RDP (RSE and LPEX). You will also learn the steps to create a menu using SDA. You will learn some tips that you can use to help improve your IBM i operations. We will also discuss how you can use Management Central as a tool to manage a single system or a network of TCP/IP connected Power Systems with IBM i.</p>
