# Short Summary
This is an intermediate course for people who need to write and maintain Rexx programs in the z/OS system environment. 

# Duration in Hours âŒš
36

# Content Description
<p>This course is designed to teach you the basic skills required to write programs using the REXX language in z/OS. The course covers the TSO extensions to REXX and interaction with other environments such as the MVS console, running REXX in batch jobs, and compiling REXX.</p>

# Objectives
<ul />
	<li />Write programs using the Rexx language
	<li />Use various data parsing techniques
	<li />Use built-in Rexx functions
	<li />Create user-defined internal and external functions and subroutines
	<li />Issue host commands from within Rexx execs
	<li />Code programs that read and write data sets
	<li />Use instructions and commands that manipulate the data stack
	<li />Use Rexx debugging tools
	<li />Write error-handling routines
