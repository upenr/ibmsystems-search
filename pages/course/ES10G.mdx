# Content Description
<p>This course is designed to teach you the fundamental practical skills to navigate and work in a z/OS environment.</p>

<p>This includes the use of ISPF/PDF dialogs, TSO/E commands, JCL, UNIX System Services shell, and BookManager.</p>

# Objectives
<ul />
	<li />Review the main concepts of z/OS
	<li />Log on to TSO and start ISPF/PDF
	<li />Navigate through ISPF/PDF dialogs and use the basic ISPF/PDF functions and the ISPF Editor
	<li />Use ISPF/PDF to allocate data sets and edit data sets (including hierarchical file system (HFS) files) using the ISPF Editor primary and line commands
	<li />Use ISPF to create and manipulate (copy, rename, delete, list, sort, and merge) data sets
	<li />Identify security considerations for Multiple Virtual Storage (MVS) data sets and HFS files
	<li />Describe and use TSO/E commands
	<li />Perform simple modifications to existing ISPF/PDF panels
	<li />Invoke a REXX exec and TSO CLIST
	<li />Tailor existing JCL and submit batch jobs
	<li />Review job status and job output using SDSF
	<li />Invoke UNIX processes
	<li />Manipulate HFS directories and file systems using the UNIX System
	<li />Services ISHELL
