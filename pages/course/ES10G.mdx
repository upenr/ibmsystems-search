# Content Description
This course is designed to teach you the fundamental practical skills to navigate and work in a z/OS environment.


This includes the use of ISPF/PDF dialogs, TSO/E commands, JCL, UNIX System Services shell, and BookManager.



# Objectives
* Review the main concepts of z/OS
* Log on to TSO and start ISPF/PDF
* Navigate through ISPF/PDF dialogs and use the basic ISPF/PDF functions and the ISPF Editor
* Use ISPF/PDF to allocate data sets and edit data sets (including hierarchical file system (HFS) files) using the ISPF Editor primary and line commands
* Use ISPF to create and manipulate (copy, rename, delete, list, sort, and merge) data sets
* Identify security considerations for Multiple Virtual Storage (MVS) data sets and HFS files
* Describe and use TSO/E commands
* Perform simple modifications to existing ISPF/PDF panels
* Invoke a REXX exec and TSO CLIST
* Tailor existing JCL and submit batch jobs
* Review job status and job output using SDSF
* Invoke UNIX processes
* Manipulate HFS directories and file systems using the UNIX System
* Services ISHELL
