# Content Description
This course teaches the students about the IBM Virtualization Engine TS7700 family. This class has no hands-on labs.



# Objectives
This two-day lecture class is designed to examine the IBM Virtualization Engine TS7700 family. It provides the students with an overview of all the components that make up the TS7700 subsystem. This class goes into how the TS7700 is defined using hardware configuration definition (HCD). It explains the concept of Grid and the operation of the Grid. This class discusses advanced policy management, pre-install planning, and performance. This class also discusses the management components and Grid disaster and failover. This course will conclude by going over what was announced in Rel 1.1 through Rel 5.1. We will discuss in detail items that are the most important in each release.
