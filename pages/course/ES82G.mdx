# Content Description
This course is designed to provide an understanding of today's complex system mainframe environment on the zEnterprise System and System z servers. It is mainly targeted for operators technical support, system programmers, and any others who need to keep current in this mainframe environment. Through lecture and hands-on exercises, you learn how the hardware and operating systems interact.

This course addresses the following topics:

* Mainframes and distributed server comparisons: Why so many servers?
* Mainframe directions: Past, current, and future
* Mainframes: System z introduction and relative performance comparisons
* IBM System z hardware design: Frames, CEC cage, books, models, and MSUs
* System z Capacity on Demand
* Physical/Logical partitioning, server initialization, and CHPIDs
* I/O configuration and HCD overview
* MVS to z/OS software overview
* z/OS Parallel Sysplex
* z/OS enhancements on the zPlatform
* z/Architecture overview and virtual addressing concepts
* System concepts: The big picture
* HMC introduction, groups, and activation profiles
* Determining object status and error conditions
* Activation and operating system interface
