# Content Description
<p>This course is designed to provide an understanding of today's complex system mainframe environment on the zEnterprise System and System z servers. It is mainly targeted for operators technical support, system programmers, and any others who need to keep current in this mainframe environment. Through lecture and hands-on exercises, you learn how the hardware and operating systems interact.</p><p>This course addresses the following topics:</p><ul /><li />Mainframes and distributed server comparisons: Why so many servers?<li />Mainframe directions: Past, current, and future<li />Mainframes: System z introduction and relative performance comparisons<li />IBM System z hardware design: Frames, CEC cage, books, models, and MSUs<li />System z Capacity on Demand<li />Physical/Logical partitioning, server initialization, and CHPIDs<li />I/O configuration and HCD overview<li />MVS to z/OS software overview<li />z/OS Parallel Sysplex<li />z/OS enhancements on the zPlatform<li />z/Architecture overview and virtual addressing concepts<li />System concepts: The big picture<li />HMC introduction, groups, and activation profiles<li />Determining object status and error conditions<li />Activation and operating system interface
