# Content Description
<p>This course is designed to provide an understanding of today's complex system mainframe environment on the zEnterprise System and System z servers. It is mainly targeted for operators technical support, system programmers, and any others who need to keep current in this mainframe environment. Through lecture and hands-on exercises, you learn how the hardware and operating systems interact.</p><p>This course addresses the following topics:</p><ul><li>Mainframes and distributed server comparisons: Why so many servers?</li><li>Mainframe directions: Past, current, and future</li><li>Mainframes: System z introduction and relative performance comparisons</li><li>IBM System z hardware design: Frames, CEC cage, books, models, and MSUs</li><li>System z Capacity on Demand</li><li>Physical/Logical partitioning, server initialization, and CHPIDs</li><li>I/O configuration and HCD overview</li><li>MVS to z/OS software overview</li><li>z/OS Parallel Sysplex</li><li>z/OS enhancements on the zPlatform</li><li>z/Architecture overview and virtual addressing concepts</li><li>System concepts: The big picture</li><li>HMC introduction, groups, and activation profiles</li><li>Determining object status and error conditions</li><li>Activation and operating system interface</li></ul>
