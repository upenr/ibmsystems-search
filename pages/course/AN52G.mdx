# Short Summary
The audience for this training includes AIX technical support personnel, performance benchmark personnel, and AIX system administrators. 

# Duration in Hours âŒš
32

# Content Description
Develop the skills to use kernel traces, trace based utilities, and svmon to measure and analyze CPU, memory, and I/O performance issues on IBM Infrastructure running AIX. Reinforce each lecture during extensive hands-on lab exercises and get practical experience applicable to their performance management requirements.



# Objectives
* Use the trace facility to collect data and create a trace report
* Use the kernel trace facilities to analyze CPU performance issues
* Describe causes and impacts of high context switching rates
* Identify what causes a thread to be blocked and later woken up
* Explain the relationship between the output of svmon -G, svmon -P, and svmon -S
* Calculate the amount of memory in use on the system
* Explain the relationship between svmon, vmstat, and ipcs output
* Categorize the memory in use on the system by segment type
* Identify which processes are using the most memory or paging space
* Describe the characteristics of asynchronous I/O, synchronous I/O, direct I/O, and concurrent I/O
* Identify if the expected type of I/O is being executed
* Tune asynchronous I/O
