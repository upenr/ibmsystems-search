# Short Summary
This course teaches a system operator how to work with and manage a Power system with IBM i.  The follow on course is AS27G. OL19G may also be of interest.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
32

# Content Description
This introductory course enables a new system operator to develop basic to intermediate level skills needed for day-to-day operations of the Power System with IBM i. Focus is given to using the GUI (IBM i Access Client Solutions and IBM Navigator for i) as well as 5250 emulation sessions to perform tasks including job control, monitoring, sending messages, managing systems devices, and more. Hands-on exercises reinforce the lecture topics and prepare the student to successfully operate a Power System with IBM i.



# Objectives
* Use the online help and references
* Send, display, and reply to messages
* Monitor and control jobs, devices, and job and output queues
* Start and stop the system
* Create and change user profiles
* Use authorization lists and group profiles
* Manage system configurationÂ  --> this could be the replacement for Manage system devices, user display stations, and printers
* Save and restore objects, libraries, and the system
* Monitor job and history logs
* Diagnose a system problem
* Order, receive, and apply PTFs
* Perform all of these functions using a 5250 emulation session as well as IBM i Access Client Solutions and IBM Navigator for i
