# Content Description
<p>This introductory course enables a new system operator to develop basic to intermediate level skills needed for day-to-day operations of the Power System with IBM i. Focus is given to using the GUI (IBM i Access Client Solutions and IBM Navigator for i) as well as 5250 emulation sessions to perform tasks including job control, monitoring, sending messages, managing systems devices, and more. Hands-on exercises reinforce the lecture topics and prepare the student to successfully operate a Power System with IBM i.</p>

# Objectives
<ul>
	<li>Use the online help and references</li>
	<li>Send, display, and reply to messages</li>
	<li>Monitor and control jobs, devices, and job and output queues</li>
	<li>Start and stop the system</li>
	<li>Create and change user profiles</li>
	<li>Use authorization lists and group profiles</li>
	<li>Manage system configuration&nbsp; --&gt; this could be the replacement for Manage system devices, user display stations, and printers</li>
	<li>Save and restore objects, libraries, and the system</li>
	<li>Monitor job and history logs</li>
	<li>Diagnose a system problem</li>
	<li>Order, receive, and apply PTFs</li>
	<li>Perform all of these functions using a 5250 emulation session as well as IBM i Access Client Solutions and IBM Navigator for i</li>
</ul>
