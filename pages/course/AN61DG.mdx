# Short Summary
This course is designed to prepare students to install and configure a highly available cluster using PowerHA SystemMirror for AIX. A high availability solution ensures that the failure of any component of the solution, be it hardware, software, or system management, does not cause the application and its data to be inaccessible to the user community. As someone in IT, you understand the importance of a highly available infrastructure, and that's where PowerHA SystemMirror comes in.

# Content Description
This course is designed to prepare students to install and configure a highly available cluster using PowerHA SystemMirror for AIX. A high availability solution ensures that the failure of any component of the solution, be it hardware, software, or system management, does not cause the application and its data to be inaccessible to the user community.

As someone in IT, you understand the importance of a highly available infrastructure, and that's where PowerHA SystemMirror comes in.

Over the course of three days, we'll take you on a journey through IBM PowerHA SystemMirror.

On Day 1, we'll introduce you to the basics of PowerHA SystemMirror, including cluster planning and exploring failover scenarios. You'll also learn how to configure your network and storage for optimal performance. Through hands-on exercises, you'll prepare your AIX environment and install and maintain PowerHA SystemMirror.

On Day 2, we'll dive deeper into the configuration of applications for PowerHA SystemMirror. You'll learn how to prepare an application for integration with SystemMirror, configure a PowerHA SystemMirror cluster, and validate and test the cluster to ensure it's working correctly.

On Day 3, we'll explore the events flow and basic troubleshooting techniques for PowerHA SystemMirror. You'll also have the opportunity to practice problem determination skills and fine-tune your installation and maintenance knowledge.

Whether you're an experienced engineer or new to PowerHA SystemMirror, this course is a must-have for anyone looking to build a highly available infrastructure. Join us.

Completion of this course will get you an IBM badge!
