# Short Summary
This is a basic course for users, who want a basic understanding of the IMS database and IMS/TM products, and Information Technology professionals, who work with or manage an IMS system (Database)

# Duration in Hours âŒš
24

# Content Description
<p>Learn about the basic Information Management System (IMS): IMS facilities, the IMS database system, and the IMS Transaction Manager (IMS/TM). Explore how these facilities work together and how application programs interact with them in today&#39;s complex enterprise systems.</p>

<p>This course has 30 hours of instruction.</p>

<p>This course uses a Web conference medium with live instructor audio and Internet Web conferenced material. You have chat-type Question and Answer (Q and A) ability, plus live audio. The course is taught 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon and 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. Central time for six work days over a two-week period. Since the course is taught live using Web conferencing methods, you can attend from your home or work. Class durations are approximately one-half day so you can still accommodate daily work responsibilities. You will be contacted prior to class start to receive connection information, hardcopy student materials, and other relevant information.</p>
