# Short Summary
This is a basic course for users, who want a basic understanding of the IMS database and IMS/TM products, and Information Technology professionals, who work with or manage an IMS system (Database)

# Duration in Hours âŒš
24

# Content Description
<p>Learn about the basic Information Management System (IMS): IMS facilities, the IMS database system, and the IMS Transaction Manager (IMS/TM). Explore how these facilities work together and how application programs interact with them in today&#39;s complex enterprise systems.</p>

<p>This course has 30 hours of instruction.</p>

<p>This course uses a Web conference medium with live instructor audio and Internet Web conferenced material. You have chat-type Question and Answer (Q and A) ability, plus live audio. The course is taught 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon and 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. Central time for six work days over a two-week period. Since the course is taught live using Web conferencing methods, you can attend from your home or work. Class durations are approximately one-half day so you can still accommodate daily work responsibilities. You will be contacted prior to class start to receive connection information, hardcopy student materials, and other relevant information.</p>

# Objectives
<ul />
	<li />Understand the components and benefits of an IMS Database system
	<li />Describe the processing of a database record in hierarchic sequence
	<li />Identify the different IMS database organization types
	<li />Understand the differences between Database Description (DBD) and Program Specification Block (PSB) control blocks
	<li />Contrast the requirements and effects of sequential versus direct access of database segments
	<li />Explain reasons for the use of secondary indexes and logical relationships
	<li />Contrast full-function and Fast Path database organizations
	<li />List the basic IMS Data Communications functions of the IMS Transaction Manager (IMS/TM)
	<li />Identify the roles of messages, queues, and logical terminal names
	<li />Explain the different scheduling characteristics of the IMS/TM regions types: Message Processing, Batch Message Processing, and Interactive Fast Path
	<li />Describe the role of commit points in recovery and restart
	<li />Identify the functions of dynamic and batch backout, the system log and the benefits of periodically backing up a database
	<li />Explain the capabilities of a conversational program and its implications on processing and performance
	<li />Describe the function of Database Recovery Control (DBRC), Integrated Resource Lock Manager (IRLM) for data sharing and distributed processing
	<li />Understand how DB2 data can be accessed by IMS TM, IMS DB databases can be accessed through &nbsp;the DBCTL interface by CICS, and how IMS DB data and IMS TM transactions can be accessed from the internet
