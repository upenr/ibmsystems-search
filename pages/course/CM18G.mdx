# Short Summary
This intermediate course is for individuals responsible for writing programs in Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL), or Programming Language One (PL/I) using DL/I.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
16

# Content Description
<p>Learn how to write application programs that use Data Language One (DL/I) to process terminal input and output messages in an Information Management System / Data Communications (IMS/DC) system.</p>

# Objectives
<ul />
	<li />Modify an IMS batch DL/I application program to function in an IMS/DC environment: receiving a message from a terminal and sending output messages to terminals
	<li />Handle the exception conditions that may occur using DL/I functions
	<li />Work with Scratch Pad Areas (SPA) in an IMS-conversational program
	<li />Understand the application program considerations in using Message Format Services (MFS) and the system service functions data structures


# Agenda
<ul /><li />IMS TM System Overview<li />Message Processing Programming<li />Get/Send Terminal Data<li />Message Format Services (MFS)<li />Create and use MFS control blocks<li />IMS/TM Additional Facilities

# Audience
<p>This intermediate course is for individuals responsible for writing programs in Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL), or Programming Language One (PL/I) using DL/I to communicate with terminals in an IMS/DC system.</p>
