# Short Summary
This intermediate course is for individuals responsible for writing programs in Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL), or Programming Language One (PL/I) using DL/I.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
16

# Content Description
Learn how to write application programs that use Data Language One (DL/I) to process terminal input and output messages in an Information Management System / Data Communications (IMS/DC) system.



# Objectives
* Modify an IMS batch DL/I application program to function in an IMS/DC environment: receiving a message from a terminal and sending output messages to terminals
* Handle the exception conditions that may occur using DL/I functions
* Work with Scratch Pad Areas (SPA) in an IMS-conversational program
* Understand the application program considerations in using Message Format Services (MFS) and the system service functions data structures


# Agenda
* IMS TM System Overview
* Message Processing Programming
* Get/Send Terminal Data
* Message Format Services (MFS)
* Create and use MFS control blocks
* IMS/TM Additional Facilities


# Audience
This intermediate course is for individuals responsible for writing programs in Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL), or Programming Language One (PL/I) using DL/I to communicate with terminals in an IMS/DC system.
