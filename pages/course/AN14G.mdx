# Content Description
Provide focused training for experienced UNIX administrators on how to install, customize, and administer the AIX operating system in a multiuser POWER (System p) partitioned environment. The course is based on AIX 7.1 running on a Power system managed by Hardware Management Console version 7 and provides practical discussions that are appropriate to earlier AIX releases.



# Objectives
* Install the AIX operating system, filesets, and RedHat Package Manager (RPM) packages

* Manage physical and logical devices
* Discuss the purpose of the logical volume manager
* Perform logical volume and file system management
* Perform and restore system backups
* Use the AIX error log as a tool in problem determination
* Configure Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) networking

# Prerequisites
You should be able to use basic UNIX commands to:


* Execute basic AIX commands
* Manage files and directories
* Use the vi editor
* Use redirection, pipes, and tees
* Use the utilities find and grep
* Use command and variable substitution
* Set and change Korn shell variables
