# Duration in Hours âŒš
40

# Content Description
<p>Provide focused training for experienced UNIX administrators on how to install, customize, and administer the AIX operating system in a multiuser POWER (System p) partitioned environment. The course is based on AIX 7.1 running on a Power system managed by Hardware Management Console version 7 and provides practical discussions that are appropriate to earlier AIX releases.</p>

# Objectives
<ul />
	<li />Install the AIX operating system, filesets, and RedHat Package Manager (RPM) packages
	<li />Perform system startup and shutdown
	<li />Discuss and use system management tools such as System Management Interface Tool (SMIT) and IBM Systems Director console for AIX
	<li />Manage physical and logical devices
	<li />Discuss the purpose of the logical volume manager
	<li />Perform logical volume and file system management
	<li />Perform and restore system backups
	<li />Use the AIX error log as a tool in problem determination
	<li />Configure Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) networking
