# Short Summary
This intermediate course should include system and subsystem programmers and personnel responsible for the implementation of the hardware and software for a Parallel Sysplex. 

# Duration in Hours âŒš
36

# Content Description
<p>This course is developed for systems programmers working on an implementation of a Parallel Sysplex. It covers the details of z/OS and z/OS-related products and subsystems exploiting the Parallel Sysplex components. It is focused on the resource sharing side.</p>

# Objectives
<ul />
	<li />Understand the steps to implement a basic and full Parallel Sysplex
	<li />Implement a basic sysplex
	<li />Implement a multisystem base sysplex
	<li />Implement the connectivity for a Parallel Sysplex
	<li />Implement the features and functions of a Parallel Sysplex
	<li />Implement the coupling facility key exploiters
	<li />Understand the different recovery scenarios
