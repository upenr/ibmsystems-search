# Short Summary
This intermediate course should include system and subsystem programmers and personnel responsible for the implementation of the hardware and software for a Parallel Sysplex. 

# Duration in Hours âŒš
36

# Content Description
This course is developed for systems programmers working on an implementation of a Parallel Sysplex. It covers the details of z/OS and z/OS-related products and subsystems exploiting the Parallel Sysplex components. It is focused on the resource sharing side.



# Objectives
* Understand the steps to implement a basic and full Parallel Sysplex
* Implement a basic sysplex
* Implement a multisystem base sysplex
* Implement the connectivity for a Parallel Sysplex
* Implement the features and functions of a Parallel Sysplex
* Implement the coupling facility key exploiters
* Understand the different recovery scenarios


# Agenda
**Day 1**

* Welcome
* Unit 1: Sysplex: Overview and definitions Lab 2: Building two stand-alone systems

**Day 2**

* Unit 2: Base sysplex definitions and commands
* Unit 3: Hardware Management Console Lab 3: Building a two system base sysplex

**Day 3**

* Unit 4: Base sysplex migration to Parallel Sysplex
* Unit 5: Coupling Facility architecture
* Lab 4: Base to Parallel Sysplex migration dynamically Lab 5: Dynamically add a third CF to sysplex

**Day 4**

* Lab 6: Implementation of CF exploiters

**Day 5**

* Unit 6: Sysplex operation and recovery
* Lab recovery
