# Content Description
The IBM Spectrum Virtualize software uses time-tested methodologies to deliver exceptional functionality for IBM FlashSystems, IBM SAN Volume Controller and a few other products. It's a key product powering storage virtualization in IBM block storage devices.

Most organizations require efficient storage administrators. As systems move into private or public clouds, the storage administrator should learn the fundamentals of how to efficiently manage day-to-day operations of these workloads.

This course will attempt to clarify the concepts involved in setting up Ansible and performing some storage administrative tasks with it. We will cover the product architecture of Ansible, explain its benefits while showing IBM's stride in this direction as it relates to IBM Spectrum Virtualize.
