# Content Description
<p>This course begins with an introduction to the z/OS environment, TSO and ISPF/PDF, batch processing, and z/OS data sets. Hands-on labs allow you to gain experience with viewing and allocating data sets, submitting a batch job, and viewing job output. After the introduction to z/OS, you will then learn, through lecture and exercises, how to use basic RACF command parameters and panels to define users and groups, protect general resources, z/OS data sets, and choose a basic set of RACF options.</p>

# Objectives
<ul>
	<li>List and describe the basic features and concepts of zSeries architecture and of the z/OS operating system as they relate to security administration</li>
	<li>Describe the allocation process for data sets in the z/OS environment</li>
	<li>Identify the security requirements of a system</li>
	<li>Use the basic facilities and features of RACF</li>
	<li>Define users to RACF</li>
	<li>Set up an RACF group structure</li>
	<li>Use RACF to protect resources</li>
	<li>Select a base set of options to tailor RACF</li>
</ul>
