# Content Description
Do you need to know how to establish a practical performance management program for your z/OS system? This course is designed for new performance analysts to learn to work with the Workload Manager (WLM) in goal mode. Learn concepts of WLM and performance management in the z/OS system using the WLM.


Learn how to analyze Resource Monitoring Facility (RMF) reports and implement service definitions using the WLM Interactive System Productivity Facility (ISPF) application. The course uses z/OS hands-on lab exercises to reinforce the concepts and techniques discussed in lecture.


**Hands-on labs**


This course includes hands-on lab exercises. Each student team, working on their own z/OS system, will configure RMF, analyze RMF reports to find bottlenecks, and utilize the WLM dialogs to create goals and classification rules in a service definition that manages a supplied z/OS workload.



# Objectives
* Describe a performance and tuning methodology
* Develop a systematic z/OS performance and tuning plan
* Describe the factors which could affect the performance of an z/OS system
* Use the WLM ISPF application
* Describe the components of a service definition
* Define workloads and service levels and classification rules
* State which z/OS commands affect WLM operation
* Identify the major WLM services for z/OS, including enclaves and application environments, and how they are used by DB2, WebSphere, and CICS
* Analyze CPU performance when running in a shared LPAR environment
* Utilize and monitor zIIP and zAAP specialty engines
* Measure and tune z/OS DASD, processor storage, and coupling facility configurations
* Explain the functions and facilities of RMF and SMF
* Analyze performance bottlenecks using RMF
* Use Workload License Charges (WLC), defined capacity and soft capping to manage software costs
* Describe advanced z/OS environments that utilize Intelligent Resource Director (IRD), HiperDispatch, z/OSMF Workload Management, and I/O Priority Manager
* Use the z/OSMF Workload Management (WLM) task
	+ Use Performance Monitoring with z/OSMF
	+ Modify a WLM service definition to meet the requirements for monitoring a specific system workload
	+ Create and customize Monitoring Desktops
	+ Review any issues by using the Monitoring Desktops options displays
	+ Assess the performance of the workloads running on the z/OS
