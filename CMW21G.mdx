# Short Summary
This advanced course is for experienced IMS system programmers or performance analysts responsible for the performance of a large-scale IMS DB/DC system.

# Duration in Hours âŒš
24

# Content Description
Learn a methodology to improve the performance of a large-scale z/OS IMS/TM data communication system. This course explains the impact of user-specified options on IMS performance, how to determine performance bottlenecks by interpreting information from certain performance reports, and how to use the information gained to implement a plan to improve the performance of an IMS system.



# Objectives
* Create and implement a performance improvement plan based on the methodology presented
* Discuss the performance options available to the IMS user
* Describe the performance impact of the IMS storage pools and datasets and their interrelationships
* Interpret the information contained in performance reports
* Analyze the performance reports to determine performance bottlenecks in the IMS system


# Agenda
* Monitoring and Tuning Overview
* IMS Structure and Major Control Blocks
* The IMS Logger and Pool Management
* IMS Communication Component
* IMS OTMA (Open Transaction Management Access) Communication Component
* z/OS Considerations for IMS
* IMS Scheduling
* IMS Program Loading Options
* IMS Program Elapsed Time
* IMS Database Buffering


# Audience
This advanced course is for experienced IMS system programmers or performance analysts responsible for the performance of a large-scale IMS DB/DC system.
